With risks abound, the unwavering commitment \nof policymakers along with wider public acceptance remains imperative to continue with the \neconomic reform agenda and efforts to regain debt sustainability. \nThe economic adjustment programme has already yielded promising outcomes in 2023. \nInflation was contained at single-digit levels by end 2023 from its highest level recorded in \n2022, enabling the commencement of monetary policy normalisation. The economy recorded \nan expansion in the second half of 2023 bringing an end to the longest streak of economic \ncontraction of six consecutive quarters. The persistent twin deficit of the overall government \nbudget and the external current account, which was the root cause of the economic downturn, \nshowed signs of correction in 2023. While a surplus was recorded in the primary balance \nof the Government, the external current account also recorded a surplus in 2023. External \nbuffers, which were almost exhausted during the crisis, were gradually rebuilt during the year. \nImproved foreign exchange inflows received from tourism and other services exports as well \nas workers\u2019 remittances, amidst subdued import demand, supported the country in alleviating \nthe severe foreign exchange crunch that prevailed at the time of the crisis. The Central Bank\u2019s \nnet purchases from foreign exchange inflows along with receipts from the multilateral partners \nhelped augment the country\u2019s international reserves. In light of these developments, along with \nenhanced confidence in the market, the Sri Lanka rupee witnessed a strengthening in 2023 and \nearly 2024. Concerted efforts to restructure the Government\u2019s external debt portfolio would \nprovide the required space for the country to make a sustainable recovery, once the process is \ncompleted. Meanwhile, domestic market interest rates declined substantially with the easing \nof monetary policy and reduction of risk premia attached to yields on government securities \nfollowing the successful finalisation of the Domestic Debt Optimisation (DDO) operation. This \ndownward adjustment in the market interest rate structure and improved market sentiments \nreversed the contractionary spell of credit extended to the private sector since June 2023. \nMeanwhile, the financial sector demonstrated its resilience stemming from the proactive \nand prudent policies of the Central Bank and the greater crisis preparedness of the financial \ninstitutions.\nEXECUTIVE SUMMARY", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 2961, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "65cee2f5-e8c3-4acf-bb5b-507ee881ad86": {"__data__": {"id_": "65cee2f5-e8c3-4acf-bb5b-507ee881ad86", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "economy_review.pdf", "file_path": "/home/lahiru-menik/Documents/Tutorial/RAG-Tutorial/data/economy_review.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9788570, "creation_date": "2025-02-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "67fe5aa6-a9a5-4b4e-b725-296606f57d52", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "21", "file_name": "economy_review.pdf", "file_path": "/home/lahiru-menik/Documents/Tutorial/RAG-Tutorial/data/economy_review.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9788570, "creation_date": "2025-02-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-15"}, "hash": "0d80224192b4ffbca63f12089a83f6eb757b4433510309cdb76a084820c3e9ea", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "Moving towards international best standards and capitalising on lessons learnt, the Central \nBank\u2019s mandate was redefined with the enactment of the Central Bank of Sri Lanka Act, No. 16 \nof 2023 (CBA) in September 2023, marking a significant milestone in enhancing the Central \nBank\u2019s independence and accountability towards the Parliament and the public. The Central \nBank implemented an array of policies in 2023, initially to bring stability to the economy and \nthen to buttress the economic recovery. This encompassed the shift from a tight monetary policy \nstance to an accommodative stance since June 2023, allowing greater flexibility in exchange \nrate determination and progressive removal of administrative restrictions imposed on certain \nforeign exchange transactions. The Central Bank guided the financial sector with prudential \nregulatory measures, preserving domestic financial system stability. With the enactment of \nCBA, in addition to its strengthened role as the supervisory and resolution authority of financial \ninstitutions, the Central Bank\u2019s role in macroprudential policy formulation was solidified, while \nits contribution to improving financial inclusion was recognised. Meanwhile, several policy \nmeasures were introduced to strengthen the safety and soundness of the banking and non-\nbank financial sector. At the same time, the Central Bank continued its efforts to develop digital \npayment systems in the economy, which would help enhance the efficiency and accessibility of \npayment methods for the public.   \nThe economic progression witnessed in the latter half of 2023 is expected to continue in \nthe years ahead, supported by the continuation of the reform agenda under the International \nMonetary Fund\u2019s Extended Fund Facility (IMF-EFF) arrangement.

The recovery was buttressed by \nrapid disinflation, improved external resilience, stronger fiscal balances, and preserved \nfinancial system stability. Prompt and coordinated implementation of a suite of policy measures \nby the Government and the Central Bank and the structural reform agenda alongside the \nInternational Monetary Fund\u2019s Extended Fund Facility (IMF-EFF) arrangement reinforced overall \nmacroeconomic stability. Having benefited from restored stability, the economy commenced \ntransitioning to a growth trajectory. After six consecutive quarters of contraction, the economy \nrecorded an expansion in the second half of 2023, limiting the annual economic contraction \nduring the year. The growth in aggregate demand was driven by both domestic demand and \nnet external demand. Although unemployment remained unchanged in comparison to the \npreceding year, labour force participation declined further in 2023. Inflation that had peaked at \nan all-time high in September 2022 reverted to single-digit levels within a year and continued \nto remain in the vicinity of the target by end 2023. With the adoption of accommodative \nmonetary policy stance by the Central Bank since mid-2023 and the decline in risk premia \nfollowing the finalisation of the Domestic Debt Optimisation (DDO) operation, market interest \nrates including yields on government securities recorded a notable decline in 2023. Credit to \nthe private sector experienced a positive shift from mid-2023, ending the longest streak of \nmonthly contractions. The external current account recorded a surplus in 2023 supported by \na significant contraction in the trade deficit amidst increased services exports and improved \nworkers\u2019 remittances. Gross official reserves improved with the support of net purchases of \nforeign exchange by the Central Bank and financing support from multilateral partners. Despite \nintermittent volatility, the Sri Lanka rupee recorded an overall appreciation in 2023, which \nbroadly reflected the market behaviour and sentiments, as the Central Bank adopted a market-\nbased exchange rate policy. Notwithstanding a series of domestic and external shocks, the \nfinancial sector demonstrated its resilience stemming from the proactive and prudent policies \nand greater crisis-preparedness.

Subdued demand due to the gradual \ntransmission of the effects of the tight monetary \nconditions to the wider economy was the major \ncontributor to this transition on the demand \nside that prevented the escalation of price \npressures. This was further complemented by \ntight fiscal measures. Further, the normalisation \nof domestic supply conditions, moderation of \nglobal commodity prices, and the strengthening \nof the Sri Lanka rupee, alongside the favourable \nstatistical base effect created by the large month-\non-month increases in prices seen in 2022 also \ncontributed to this rapid disinflation process. \nConsequently, year-on-year headline inflation, \nmeasured by the Colombo Consumer Price Index \n(CCPI, 2021=100), decelerated to 1.3 per cent \nin September 2023. The prices of food items \nand the transport sector, which were two of the \nlargest contributors to the high inflation episode \nfinancial sector, was able to maintain stability by preserving capital adequacy level, supported \nby the decline in risk weighted assets, while liquidity was maintained above the regulatory \nminimum. Total assets of the banking sector improved along with profitability, while credit \nrisk as indicated by the Stage 3 loans ratio increased during 2023. The fiscal performance in \n2023 was commendable, driven by rigorous consolidation measures for revenue enhancement \nand expenditure rationalisation. The primary balance showed a surplus in 2023, while the \noverall budget deficit declined compared to previous year. The Government continued to rely \nprimarily on domestic sources to finance the budget deficit, amidst constraints in accessing \nforeign sources. The central government debt as a percentage of GDP declined by end 2023, \nprimarily due to the growth in nominal GDP and partly due to the impact of rupee appreciation \non foreign debt.\nduring the preceding year, recorded deflation \nduring several months in 2023. This was primarily \ndue to the normalisation of supply bottlenecks \nand cost-reflective fuel price adjustments, amidst \nthe normalisation of global crude oil prices, \ntogether with the impact of the appreciation \nof the exchange rate. The frequent changes in \nelectricity tariffs, due to the implementation of \ncost-reflective pricing, also contributed to the \ndynamics of inflation during 2023. In particular, \nthe pace of disinflation slowed during the first \nquarter of 2023 due to the upward adjustment \nto the electricity tariffs, while the subsequent \nreduction of tariffs in July 2023 supported the \ndecline in inflation. However, since September \n2023, inflation has been moving upward \ntowards the targeted level, as anticipated, due \nto energy price hikes, particularly the electricity \ntariff increase, while weather related disruptions \nto the agriculture sector also contributed to the \npickup in inflation, particularly towards the end of \nthe year.

The fall in \ncore inflation mirrored the underlying subdued \ndemand conditions in the economy, amidst \nthe tight monetary conditions until June 2023 \nand prevailing tight fiscal conditions, and the \npersistent impact of the erosion of the purchasing \npower of the public. Unlike headline inflation, \nwhich picked up during the latter part of 2023, \nCCPI-based core inflation continued to decelerate \nthroughout 2023 and has accelerated somewhat \nsince then. This behaviour reflects that the \nacceleration in headline inflation in late 2023 \nwas mainly due to the price increases in energy \nand volatile food items, which are excluded when \ncalculating core inflation. Accordingly,  \nCCPI-based year-on-year core inflation fell \nto 0.6 per cent (2021=100) by end 2023 \ncompared to 47.7 per cent (2013=100) by \nend 2022, while CCPI-based annual average \ncore inflation in 2023 was recorded at 14.5 \nper cent (2021=100) compared to 34.6 per \ncent (2013=100) in 2022.

In the \nSri Lankan context, irregular weather patterns \nare a major factor affecting inflation through the \nsupply side, causing frequent volatilities in food \ninflation. Similar to many other countries, Sri \nLanka is also threatened by the effects of climate \nchange on economic activity and social wellbeing. \nAdditionally, changes in global supply chains, as \nwell as the increase of production costs amidst \nsupply bottlenecks are the main causes for the \nrecent volatility in inflation through the supply side. If \nthese supply side pressures are short lived, they may \nnot pose any major monetary policy implications. \nHowever, persistent acceleration of inflation due \nto supply factors could complicate the conduct of \nmonetary policy, mainly due to the possible de-\nanchoring of inflation expectations and it can have \nan adverse impact on a central bank\u2019s credibility. \nLiterature shows that when the supply shock is \ntransitory, inflation returns to the equilibrium without \nthe need for any monetary policy action, while \nrepeated supply shocks trigger second round effects, \nwarranting pre-emptive monetary policy action \n(John, Kumar and Patra, 2022).\nThe Impact of Weather Patterns and Climate \nChange on Inflation in Sri Lanka\nClimate change encompasses enduring alterations \nin temperature and various facets of the earth's \nclimate system, largely attributed to human activities. \nIts impacts are extensive and diverse, spanning \nenvironmental, social, economic, and health \nimplications. Irregular weather patterns and climate \nchange can result in significant fluctuations in food \ninflation. In turn, it could lead to higher volatility in \nheadline inflation, particularly in a country like Sri \nLanka, where food items account for a large share \nof the consumption basket.1 The agricultural sector \ncould be affected mainly by changes in rainfall \npatterns and rising temperatures. Major crops in Sri \n1  The Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI) and the National Consumer Price Index   \n(NCPI) are the measures of inflation in Sri Lanka.  Out of 12 categories, the food \ncategory has the most significant weight in both indices, accounting for 26.2 per cent \nin CCPI and 39.2 per cent in NCPI.\nLanka, including rice and coconut, are significantly \naffected2 by variations in temperature and rainfall. \nAn increase in nighttime temperatures, particularly \ndue to global warming, significantly decreases rice \nyields. For example, based on the field experiments \nconducted at the International Rice Research \nInstitution in the Philippines, rice yields are found to \ndecline by 10 per cent for every 1\u00b0C increase in the \nminimum temperature during the dry season (Peng \net al., 2004). Although the trend of vegetable and \nfruit prices can be usually predicted during normal \nweather seasons, the impact of climate change or \nthe abnormal weather patterns on rice, vegetables, \nand fruits make their pricing unpredictable. In \naddition to the above, prolonged drought conditions \ncould impact electricity prices due to a shift from \nlow cost hydro power to costly fuel based electricity \ngeneration, thus transmitting weather and climate \nrelated disturbances to the wider economy, creating \nlarge supply disruptions.\nTherefore, extreme weather events can have \nsignificant macroeconomic effects. These effects \nwere perceived to be largely transitory and  less of \na concern for central banks in the past.

Therefore, any monetary \npolicy response to a series of supply shocks should \nbe based on the overall macroeconomic impact of \nsuch shocks and should also incorporate a careful \nassessment of the dynamics of inflation expectations. \nMoreover, amidst larger and persistent supply \nshocks, frontloading of monetary policy actions can \nkeep inflation expectations firmly anchored thus \nmaintaining the credibility of the central bank (John \net al., 2022).\nYear Headline\nInflation Supply Non-Supply\n2015 1.3 2.8 1.3\n2016 1.1 2.5 0.8\n2017 0.9 2.2 1.0\n2018 1.0 2.1 0.2\n2019 0.6 1.7 0.5\n2020 0.8 1.3 0.5\n2021 2.6 3.9 1.6\n2022 20.3 32.0 11.0\n2023 20.1 29.9 12.9\nSource: Department of Census and Statistics \n            Central Bank Staff Calculations\nTable \nB 1.1\nStandard Deviation of Supply Side and Non-Supply \nSide Inflation (CCPI-based, year-on-year, %)", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 2810, "end_char_idx": 4692, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6649c367-5795-40ae-b351-8484e4c9a607": {"__data__": {"id_": "6649c367-5795-40ae-b351-8484e4c9a607", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "31", "file_name": "economy_review.pdf", "file_path": "/home/lahiru-menik/Documents/Tutorial/RAG-Tutorial/data/economy_review.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9788570, "creation_date": "2025-02-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "f520b6db-1db6-44fc-b672-5e86a7dc2ffa", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "31", "file_name": "economy_review.pdf", "file_path": "/home/lahiru-menik/Documents/Tutorial/RAG-Tutorial/data/economy_review.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9788570, "creation_date": "2025-02-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-15"}, "hash": "6cbc59828d19394aac2bf099178fd818fff10a9084eaa4d323d4887e2943e645", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c4404f2b-360b-45dc-adf5-07cfe662fc30", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "890cbba5bf9c71a86dd8752e204ec9787c1d92e3d257cd6a8356ec2c9bac2470", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL ECONOMIC REVIEW 2023\n1\n10\nPer cent\n2013=100 2021=100\nDec-2019 Dec-2020 Dec-2021 Sep-2022 Dec-2022 Sep-2023 Dec-2023 Jan-2024 Feb-2024 Mar-2024\nHeadline CCPI 4.8 4.2 12.1 69.8 57.2 1.3 4.0 6.4 5.9 0.9\nInflation NCPI 6.2 4.6 14.0 73.7 59.2 0.8 4.2 6.5 5.1\nCore CCPI 4.8 3.5 8.3 50.2 47.7 1.9 0.6 2.2 2.8 3.1\nInflation NCPI 5.2 4.7 10.8 64.1 57.5 1.7 0.9 2.2 2.7\nFood CCPI 6.3 9.2 22.1 94.9 64.4 -5.2 0.3 3.3 3.5 3.8\nInflation NCPI 8.6 7.5 21.5 85.8 59.3 -5.2 1.6 4.1 5.0\nNon-Food CCPI 4.3 2.0 7.5 57.6 53.4 4.7 5.8 7.9 7.0 -0.5\nInflation NCPI 4.2 2.2 7.6 62.8 59.0 5.9 6.3 8.5 5.1\nNote: The Department of Census and Statistics (DCS) commenced publishing NCPI and CCPI with the new base year, 2021=100, from the data releases of January 2023 \nand February 2023, respectively, and discontinued the publication of NCPI and CCPI with the old base year, 2013=100.\nSource: Department of Census and Statistics\nMovements of Inflation (year-on-year)Table \n1.2\nThe Government\u2019s Role in Managing Supply \nSide Inflation\nGovernments play a crucial role in managing \nsupply side inflation through various policies \nand interventions.

In addition, the appreciation of the Sri \nLanka rupee against the US dollar, eased supply \nside disruptions, moderation of global commodity \nprices, and relaxation of import restrictions \ncontributed to driving inflation expectations \ndownward. Accordingly, the inflation expectations \nof the corporate sector reached single digit \nlevels by August 2023. Subsequently, inflation \nexpectations declined further with the exception of \nmarginal increases in October 2023 attributed to \nthe electricity tariff adjustments and in December \n2023 following the announcement of VAT \namendments. Meanwhile, inflation expectations \nof the household sector reached single digit levels \nby November 2023 followed by a slight uptick in \nDecember 2023.\n1.1.2 Prices\nThe general price level, measured by \nboth CCPI and NCPI, exhibited a modest \nincrease in 2023 from substantially high \nlevels in the preceding year. Prices of both \ndomestically produced and imported food items \nincreased, though at a slower rate compared to \nthe substantial price hikes witnessed in 2022. \nMoreover, price movements of non-food items \nwere primarily impacted by the cost-reflective \npricing adjustments made throughout the year. In \nline with these developments, the cost of living of \nthe economy, as indicated by the consumer price \nindices, continued to increase in 2023, but at a \nslower rate compared to 2022.\nPrices of food items, which were primarily \ndriven by supply side factors, albeit with \nperiodic influence from demand side factors \nduring festive seasons, exhibited a modest \nincrease compared to the substantial price \nhikes witnessed in 2022. With the adequate \nsupply of chemical fertiliser and decreased \ninput costs, in line with reductions in fuel \nprices, a favourable harvest was realised. This \ntranslated into a decline in the prices of certain \ndomestically produced food items during the \nyear. Nevertheless, in the latter part of the \nyear, extreme weather conditions across the \nentire island coupled with festive demand, led \nto substantial increases in volatile food prices. \nMeanwhile, prices of imported food items, \nwhich recorded significant increases in 2022, \nmoderated to some extent during 2023, which is \nattributable to the strengthening of the Sri Lanka \nrupee and the softening of global commodity \nprices despite export restrictions imposed by some \ncountries. \nThe cost-reflective pricing formula played a \npivotal role in shaping the price movements \nof non-food items. The prices of items in \nthe non-food category exhibited an overall \nincreasing trend in 2023, yet at a moderate pace \ncompared to the substantial increases observed \nin 2022. Accordingly, non-food prices increased \nuntil March 2023 primarily due to the upward \nrevision to electricity tariff by 146 per cent for bills \nconsuming 90 units2  effective from 16 February \n2023, while domestic consumers experienced a \ntariff hike of 66 per cent on average. However, \nstarting from March 2023, non-food prices \nexperienced a decrease until July, followed by an \nincrease until November 2023, primarily driven \nby price adjustments in several administrative \nitems. There was a downward adjustment to the \nelectricity tariff by 24 per cent for bills consuming \n90 units effective from 01 July 2023 followed \nby an upward revision of 18 per cent effective \nfrom 20 October 2023. Further, water tariffs \nunderwent an upward price revision of 102 per \ncent for bills consuming 22 units effective from 01 \nAugust 2023, partially reflecting the changes in \nelectricity tariff revisions.

Similarly, based \non NCPI (2021=100), the estimated average \nmonthly household5 consumption expenditure \nincreased from Rs. 88,704 in 2022 to  \nRs. 103,283 in 2023 by 16.5 per cent \nhighlighting a notable easing from the 74.9 per \ncent increase recorded in 2022. Considering \nthe distribution of consumption expenditure \nbetween food and non-food items, it is evident \nthat a major share is allocated to non-food \nitems. Further, the notable increase observed in \nthe share of monthly household consumption \nexpenditure allocated to the food category in 2022 \nmoderated in 2023 due to the improved supply \nconditions in the country.\n1.1.4 Wages\nAvailable information6 shows that wages \nremained largely stagnant throughout \n3 Consumer price indices are based on fixed consumption baskets derived from House-\nhold Income and Expenditure Survey (HIES) (2019) conducted by DCS.

This increase in nominal \nwages of employees in the informal private sector \nwas mainly attributable to the demand for higher \nwages by daily wage earners, due to the rising \ncost of living and shortage of labour supply. \nMeanwhile, on an annual average basis, real \nwages recorded an erosion during the year across \nboth the private and public sectors. Nevertheless, \navailable wage indices i.e., informal private \nsector wage rate index (2018=100), formal \nprivate sector minimum wage rate index (1978 \nDecember=100), and public sector wage rate \nindex (2016=100) exhibit certain limitations in \ncapturing the overall wage developments of the \neconomy.\nPrivate Sector Wages\nNominal wages of informal private sector \nemployees, as indicated by the informal \nprivate sector wage rate index (2018=100), \nexhibited an increasing trend throughout \n2023.

Further, a significant labour \nshortage across all sectors, attributed to the \nmigration of workers to other countries, created a \ncompetitive environment for experienced workers, \nresulting in wage increases. However, owing to \nthe high inflation environment that prevailed until \nearly 2023, employees in the informal private \nsector experienced a real wage erosion of 7.1 per \ncent in 2023, compared to the previous year. \nNominal wages of employees in the formal \nprivate sector, as measured by the minimum \nwage rate index (1978 December=100) \ncompiled by the Department of Labour, of \nemployees whose wages are governed by \nwage boards, recorded a slight increase in \n2023.

The CPC\u2019s outstanding trade \nreceivables from government entities decreased \nby Rs. 206.0 billion to stand at Rs. 17.7 billion by \nthe end of December 2023, with the restructuring \nof the CPC\u2019s trade debt receivables from \nSriLankan Airlines (SLA) and Ceylon Electricity \nBoard (CEB) in December 2023. Meanwhile, the \nsettlement of dues from SLA and CEB enabled \nCPC to settle its liabilities in relation to the Indian \ncredit line by end December 2023. \nSeveral reforms were undertaken in 2023 \nto liberalise the domestic petroleum \nmarket with the view of improving the \ncompetitiveness and efficiency of the \npetroleum sector in Sri Lanka. In March 2023, \nthe Cabinet of Ministers granted approval to \n1.2.6 Economic Infrastructure\nPower and Energy\nPetroleum\nAlthough geopolitical tensions exerted \nupward price pressures during the latter \npart of the year, the overall downward \ntrend observed in global prices of crude oil \nin 2023 together with the appreciation of \nthe Sri Lanka rupee translated into lower \ndomestic prices of petroleum products, \ncompared to 2022. Global crude oil prices \nrecorded declines in 2023, when compared to \n2022, largely on account of subdued global \ndemand offsetting voluntary production cuts by \nOPEC+ countries. Accordingly, the average \nBrent crude oil price decreased by 17.0 per cent \nto US dollars 82.22 per barrel in 2023 from US \ndollars 99.06 per barrel in 2022. In line with this \ndownward trend in global crude oil prices, the \nannual average import price of crude oil of the \nCeylon Petroleum Corporation (CPC) decreased \nto US dollars 89.60 per barrel in 2023, while the \ngradual appreciation of the Sri Lanka rupee also \nsupported the decline in import prices in rupee \nterms. Throughout the year, monthly adjustments \nwere made to domestic prices of petroleum \nproducts in line with the cost-reflective pricing \nformula. Consequently, by the end of the year, \nthe prices of Petrol 92, Auto Diesel, and Kerosene \nretailed by the CPC recorded overall reductions \nof 6.5 per cent, 21.7 per cent, and 32.3 per \ncent, respectively, compared to the end of 2022. \nHowever, further reductions were capped due \nto the imposition of an Excise Duty of Rs. 25.00 \nper litre, on imports of key refined petroleum \nproducts, in two rounds in January and June \n2023 by the Government.11  \nPetroleum sales increased in 2023, reflecting \nthe gradual restoration of economic activity \n11 VAT exemptions on major petroleum products of Petrol 92, Petrol 95, Auto Diesel, \nand Super Diesel were removed with effect from 01 January 2024, while the VAT  \nexemption on Kerosene was continued.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3853, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "6c20827e-5a0c-4d5c-b3af-4b0db5562bd4": {"__data__": {"id_": "6c20827e-5a0c-4d5c-b3af-4b0db5562bd4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "41", "file_name": "economy_review.pdf", "file_path": "/home/lahiru-menik/Documents/Tutorial/RAG-Tutorial/data/economy_review.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9788570, "creation_date": "2025-02-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c2c52001-75ba-4b7d-b6f5-c2f41f7f2dfb", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "41", "file_name": "economy_review.pdf", "file_path": "/home/lahiru-menik/Documents/Tutorial/RAG-Tutorial/data/economy_review.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9788570, "creation_date": "2025-02-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-15"}, "hash": "7cabd8ebab63476fad2af33bd4c1209acadea20f9b24664d65736eee45de16cf", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL ECONOMIC REVIEW 2023\n1\n20\naward contracts to three private companies for \nthe importation, storage, distribution, and sale \nof petroleum products through a predetermined \ndealer-operated distribution network in Sri Lanka. \nAccordingly, two foreign suppliers commenced \ntheir retail business operations in 2023 and in \nearly 2024.

Despite the favourable \nstatistical base impact stemming from a low level \nof electricity generation amidst scheduled power \noutages in 2022, electricity generation witnessed \na year-on-year contraction of 2.2 per cent in \n2023. This reflected the weak energy demand \nin the economy stemming from the combined \nimpact of cost-reflective electricity tariffs and \nsubdued economic activity. The power sector \nfaced pressures during the second and third \nquarters of 2023 due to the delayed onset of the \nSouth-West monsoon as a result of the  \nEl Ni\u00f1o effect. This resulted in an increased \nusage of expensive thermal sources for electricity \ngeneration. However, this trend reversed towards \nthe end of the third quarter of 2023, with \nimproved reservoir levels amidst unusually high \nrainfall reported from the latter part of September \n2023. During the year, hydro, fuel, coal, and \nNon-Conventional Renewable Energy (NCRE) \nsources contributed to 29 per cent, 20 per cent, \n30 per cent, and 21 per cent, respectively, of \noverall electricity generation. \nCost-reflective pricing in electricity resulted in \nimprovements in the financial performance \nof CEB. In 2023, the Government established a \nsemi-annual tariff revision mechanism to address \nthe financial woes of CEB through cost-reflective \npricing. However, due to the volatility in the \ngeneration mix, electricity tariffs were revised three \ntimes during the year, with two upward revisions \nin February and October, and a downward \nrevision in July 2023. Accordingly, the average \nelectricity tariff was revised upward by around \n66 per cent and 18 per cent, respectively, in \nFebruary and October 2023, while it was revised \ndownward by around 14 per cent in July 2023. \nFurther, based on these developments, the \nGovernment decided to reduce the tariff revision \ncycle to three months, commencing from the first \nquarter of 2024. Accordingly, electricity tariffs \nwere revised downward effective from 05 March \n2024. Regular tariff revisions contributed to a \nnotable improvement in CEB\u2019s cash flow, leading \nto a sizeable profit of Rs. 61.2 billion in 2023, \nsubsequent to recording continuous losses for \naround seven years since 2016.

Accordingly, \nthe Aswesuma welfare benefit scheme was \ninitiated in July 2023 under the purview of the \nWelfare Benefits Board (WBB) with the intention \nof replacing the Samurdhi Development \nProgramme. The programme was designed after \ndeveloping the welfare benefit information system, \nconsidering multidimensional parameters, with \nan improved verification approach to ensure \nthe effective targeting of needy sectors, while \nproviding opportunities for appeals in the event \nof non-inclusion in the benefit scheme. At the \noutset, around 1.4 million applicants out of \n3.7 million applicants were selected to receive \nbenefits under four major categories, namely, \ntransitional, vulnerable, poor, and severely poor, \nas classified under the Aswesuma programme. \nFurther, several measures were taken to \nstrengthen the selection criteria, along with data \nrecertification and verification procedures as well \nas regular reviews, to improve the targeting of the \nprogramme. Under this programme, around Rs. \n53.8 billion was disbursed in 2023. Meanwhile, \nthe Cabinet granted approval in July 2023 to \ncontinue the Samurdhi Subsidy Programme \nuntil the appeal process under the new benefit \nscheme was completed. Accordingly, as at end \n2023, the number of beneficiary families under \nthe Samurdhi Programme stood at 363, 214 \nfamilies compared to 1.7 million families at the \nbeginning of the year. While the Government\u2019s \nefforts to improve the efficacy of social assistance \nprogrammes are commendable, the lack of post \ncrisis national statistics on the status of poverty, \nvulnerability and inequality is disconcerting as \nit hinders timely poverty alleviation and social \nassistance efforts.\n1.3  Monetary Sector    \n Developments\n1.3.1 Domestic Money Market   \n Liquidity and Short Term   \n Interest Rates\nOvernight liquidity in the domestic money \nmarket improved notably in 2023 from \ndeficit levels to broadly balanced levels. \nLiquidity provision to the market through \nterm reverse repo auctions under open \nmarket operations (OMO), in addition to the \novernight liquidity provision, in line with the \naccommodative monetary policy stance and \nprovision of special liquidity assistance to certain \nlicensed banks, which had experienced persistent", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3672, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "7c99f562-90c8-414f-8811-ce267fced166": {"__data__": {"id_": "7c99f562-90c8-414f-8811-ce267fced166", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "46", "file_name": "economy_review.pdf", "file_path": "/home/lahiru-menik/Documents/Tutorial/RAG-Tutorial/data/economy_review.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9788570, "creation_date": "2025-02-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c35ac7bb-c8ce-498c-8ad6-7652005f4732", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "46", "file_name": "economy_review.pdf", "file_path": "/home/lahiru-menik/Documents/Tutorial/RAG-Tutorial/data/economy_review.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9788570, "creation_date": "2025-02-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-15"}, "hash": "78d080d7a94202e604e7cedb6fe2055839abc7683be19960be8d9cd2c982ae11", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "c7da7868-a448-4a68-a28a-5d5f68336292", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "d6931ee74d5d6f042f90e644547c6f556e7ded67197e025b6e326cc93a42b827", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "1\n25\nMACROECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND CONDITIONS OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM\nliquidity deficits were the measures taken by \nthe Central Bank to improve market liquidity.

However, with the moderation of \nyields on government securities following the \nDDO operation and improved fiscal outturn, it \ntransitioned to a normal upward sloping yield \ncurve since early 2024.\n1.3.3 Credit Aggregates\nThe turnaround of credit to the private \nsector by LCBs recorded in June 2023 ended \nthe longest streak of monthly contractions \nof credit to the private sector. The turnaround \nwas supported by the gradual relaxation of \nthe monetary policy stance and improvements \nin economic activity and market sentiments. \nAccordingly, the cumulative increase in \noutstanding credit to the private sector by LCBs \nduring June-December 2023 was Rs. 367.4 \nbillion. Despite the recovery during the second \nhalf of 2023, credit to the private sector by LCBs \nrecorded a cumulative contraction of  \nRs. 45.0 billion during 2023, registering a \nyear-on-year contraction of 0.6 per cent by end \n2023 compared to the growth of 6.2 per cent \n(year-on-year) recorded at end 2022. However, \nthe increasing trend in credit to the private sector \nby LCBs experienced an unexpected monthly \ncontraction in January 2024 (a contraction of \nRs. 52.2 billion) partly due to the advancing of \nspending in view of the implementation of VAT \nadjustments effective January 2024 and the \nsettlement of short term borrowings obtained by \nbusinesses during the end-year festive season. \nFurther, the valuation impact arising from the \nappreciation of the Sri Lanka rupee exacerbated \nthe contraction in January 2024. Nevertheless, \ncredit to the private sector expanded in February \n2024 to some extent and is anticipated to \nexpand in the period ahead, aligning with the \nenvisaged further reduction in market interest \nrates and improvements in economic activity. \nMeanwhile, credit to the private sector by \nLicensed Specialised Banks (LSBs) contracted \nby Rs. 32.9 billion during 2023, recording a \nyear-on-year contraction of 2.8 per cent by end \n2023 amidst relatively tight liquidity conditions \nof those banks and comparatively high interest \nrates. Private sector credit by Licensed Finance \nCompanies (LFCs) also contracted by Rs. 24.2 \nbillion during 2023, recording a year-on-year \ncontraction of 1.8 per cent by the end of 2023.\nCredit to the major sectors of the economy17  \nsuffered contractions during the first \nhalf of 2023 but commenced recovering \nthereafter.

However, credit \ngranted to the Industry sector remained weak \non account of the construction subsector being \nseverely affected by the lack of government \nand private sector projects stemming from \nfiscal constraints, rising raw material prices, \nand associated finance costs due to the high \ninterest rate environment in 2022 and early \n2023.

NCG by LCBs recorded an increase of \nRs. 1,870.1 billion during the year reflecting \nthe increase in investments in government \nsecurities by LCBs amidst the reduction in credit \nprovided to the private sector, and the transfer \nof government guaranteed outstanding foreign \ncurrency debt of CPC to the Government. In \ncontrast, NCG by the Central Bank recorded \na significant reduction of Rs. 1,056.3 billion \nduring 2023 mainly due to the offloading of \nTreasury bills held by the Central Bank and \nreduction in the use of SLF of the Central Bank \nby LCBs with the gradual improvements of the \nliquidity position of LCBs. The reduction in \nNCG by the Central Bank was partly due to the \nrestrictions on monetary financing introduced \nin the Central Bank of Sri Lanka Act, No. 16 \nof 2023 (CBA), which prohibited monetary \nfinancing and created a commitment to reduce \nthe government securities holding of the Central \nBank.

With the reduction in SRR \nby 200 basis points in August 2023, LCBs\u2019 \ndeposits with the Central Bank declined notably, \nalthough volatility continued as restrictions were \nstill in force during 2023. Meanwhile, currency \nin circulation, which declined significantly after \nthe festival season of April 2023, recorded \nsome expansion towards end June 2023, mainly \nreflecting the uncertainties surrounding the DDO \noperation. However, with the public gaining \ngreater clarity on DDO, a return of currency to \nthe banking system was observed since mid-July \n2023, albeit moderately.

Accordingly, reserve money contracted \nmarginally to Rs. 1,328.7 billion by end 2023, \nrecording a year-on-year contraction of 1.5 \nper cent. Meanwhile, with the relaxation of the \nrestrictions imposed on the standing facilities in \nFebruary and March 2024, the volatility of daily \nreserve money reduced somewhat.\nOn the assets side of the Central Bank\u2019s \nbalance sheet, a contraction of reserve \nmoney was recorded during 2023 entirely \ndue to the contraction in Net Domestic \nAssets (NDA) of the Central Bank surpassing \nthe expansion of its Net Foreign Assets \n(NFA) during the year. NDA of the Central \nBank declined by Rs. 797.2 billion during 2023 \nmainly due to the decline in net claims on the \nGovernment, particularly the decline in the \ngovernment securities holdings of the Central \nBank (net of repo). Nevertheless, this decline was \nsomewhat negated as retained earnings turned \nnegative from September 2023 as a result of \naccounting for the upfront day one loss incurred \nfollowing DDO, and reduction in the SDF \nplacements by LCBs, which led to the expansion \nof other items (net). Meanwhile, NFA of the \nCentral Bank, which turned negative in August \n2021, gradually improved in 2023, reflecting \nthe combined effect of increased foreign assets \nwith the accumulation of foreign reserves and \ndecreasing foreign liabilities of the Central \nBank. During 2023, NFA of the Central Bank \nimproved by Rs. 776.5 billion, albeit remaining \nnegative by the end of the year.\nDespite the expansions recorded in NCG \nand NFA of the banking system, the growth \nof broad money (M2b) supply remained \nmoderate during 2023 mainly due to the \ncontractions recorded in credit extended by \nLCBs to the private sector and SOBEs. NFA \nof the banking system improved notably by  \nRs. 1,310.7 billion during 2023 due to the \ndecline in foreign liabilities and the build-up \nof foreign assets, reflecting an improvement in \nexternal sector performance and gross official \nreserves (GOR). Settlement of foreign currency \nliabilities by the Central Bank as well as LCBs, \nhelped reduce foreign currency liabilities of \nthe banking system, while the receipts from \nmultilateral agencies as well as the retention \nof foreign exchange within the banking system \ndue to lower demand for foreign exchange \naugmented the foreign currency assets of the \nbanking system. Accordingly, driven by these \ndevelopments, the year-on-year growth of broad \nmoney (M2b) decelerated gradually to 7.3 per \ncent by end 2023 and further to 6.4 per cent \nby end January 2024 from 15.4 per cent at \nend 2022. On the liabilities side of M2b, the \nincrease in time and savings deposits held by \nthe public with LCBs contributed 77 per cent \nto the year-on-year expansion of M2b during \n2023.

The commencement \nof the IMF-EFF programme in March 2023 and \nits successful continuation thus far have been \ninstrumental in achieving stability in the external \nsector. The external current account recorded \na surplus in 2023. This was supported by the \nnotable contraction in the trade deficit and \nsignificant inflows in terms of services exports \nand workers\u2019 remittances. The merchandise \ntrade deficit for 2023 recorded its lowest since \n2010, supported by a larger contraction in \nimport expenditure than that of export earnings. \nThe increase in services account surplus is \nmainly attributed to the notable improvement \nin earnings from tourism with the robust \nrecovery in tourist arrivals after facing repeated \nchallenges over the past four years.

On the \nother hand, domestic factors, such as higher \noperating expenses and supply constraints of \nintermediate goods adversely impacted the \noverall competitiveness of exports. Further, as \na percentage of GDP, export earnings in 2023 \ndeclined to 14.1 per cent from 17.1 per cent in \n2022. \nThe decline in industrial exports largely \ncontributed to the contraction in export \nearnings, though the decline was broad-\nbased. The export of textiles and garments, the \nsingle largest export of Sri Lanka, registered an \n18.0 per cent decline in 2023 compared to \n2022, thereby emerging as a key contributor to \nthe overall decline in exports. A notable decline \nwas observed in petroleum product exports in \n2023, attributed to the lower prices of bunker \nand aviation fuel. Earnings from most other \nindustrial goods also experienced subdued \nperformance. However, gems, diamonds and \njewellery, transport equipment and machinery, \nand mechanical appliances exports recorded \na growth in 2023. Meanwhile, agricultural \nexports reported a marginal dip in earnings in \n2023 compared to 2022. Of the agricultural \nexports, the increases in mainly tea, spices, and \nunmanufactured tobacco were offset by weaker \nperformances in coconut, rubber, and seafood \nexports. The notable increase in earnings from \ntea exports reflected higher export prices despite \na decline in export volumes. Mineral exports \nrecorded a decline compared to 2022, led by \nlower titanium ores exports in 2023.\nImport Performance\nA notable contraction in import expenditure \nwas observed in 2023. Expenditure on imports \ndeclined by 8.1 per cent to US dollars 16,811 \nmillion in 2023 compared to 2022, driven by \nseveral factors, including restrictions on  \nnon-essential imports, subdued economic \nactivity, and constrained spending capabilities \nof the public due to tight monetary and fiscal \npolicies. As a percentage of GDP, import \nexpenditure declined to 19.9 per cent in 2023 \ncompared to 23.8 per cent in 2022. \nThe decline in import expenditure was a \nresult of lower intermediate and investment \ngoods imports, while expenditure on both \nfood and non-food consumer goods imports \nincreased. Expenditure on rice imports declined \nsignificantly due to lower volumes of rice \nimports in 2023 compared to 2022 although \nthis decline was offset by higher expenditure \non imports of most other food commodities, \nsuch as sugar, oils and fats, and milk powder. \nMeanwhile, expenditure on non-food consumer \ngoods increased largely due to imports of \nTextiles and garments\nTea\nRubber products\nMachinery and mechanicalappliances\nPetroleum products\nFood, beverages and tobacco\nGems, diamonds and jewellery\nSpices\nCoconut\nSeafood\nChemical products\nMinor agricultural products\nOther\nUSD billion\n0 2 4 6\nIndustrial Goods\nAgricultural Goods\nMineral and Other\nGoods\n2022 2023\n77.9%\n21.5%\n0.6%\n2023 \nUSD 11.9 bn\nSources: Sri Lanka Customs\n             Central Bank of Sri Lanka\nFigure\n1.15 Composition of Exports Figure\n1.16 Composition of Imports\n18.1%\n65.5%\n16.4%\n2023 \nUSD 16.8 bn\nConsumer Goods\nIntermediate Goods\nInvestment and Other Goods\nFuel\nTextiles and textile articles\nMachinery and equipment\n Chemical products\n Building material\n Medical and pharmaceuticals\nPlastics and articles thereof\n Sugar and confectionery\nPaper and paperboard andarticles thereof\n Vegetables (a)\nWheat and maize\nCereals and milling industryproducts\nOther\n0 2 4 6\nUSD billion\n2022 2023\n(a) Includes lentils, onions, potatoes, leguminous and other vegetables.\nSources: Sri Lanka Customs\n             Central Bank of Sri Lanka", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3722, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "127797c8-4cfb-4096-a52e-416a08321db4": {"__data__": {"id_": "127797c8-4cfb-4096-a52e-416a08321db4", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "58", "file_name": "economy_review.pdf", "file_path": "/home/lahiru-menik/Documents/Tutorial/RAG-Tutorial/data/economy_review.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9788570, "creation_date": "2025-02-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "27d48d04-4358-4247-8768-78413d4f363f", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "58", "file_name": "economy_review.pdf", "file_path": "/home/lahiru-menik/Documents/Tutorial/RAG-Tutorial/data/economy_review.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9788570, "creation_date": "2025-02-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-15"}, "hash": "07fb29df78369a5429b5914a1ddee0b4723ef2d8a0ee9cb4bdba8abd497e29e5", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "1\n37\nMACROECONOMIC DEVELOPMENTS AND CONDITIONS OF THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM\nmedical and pharmaceutical products, and \nmobile phones. In addition, most other items \ncategorised under non-food consumer goods \nshowed an increasing trend during the latter \npart of 2023 due to the relaxation of import \nrestrictions. Expenditure on intermediate \ngoods declined with textiles and textile articles \naccounting for a significant portion of the \ndecline, in line with the reduction of apparel \nexports. Expenditure on fuel imports, the largest \nitem in the import basket, declined primarily \ndue to lower import prices across all products: \ncrude oil, refined petroleum (including LP gas), \nand coal, though import volumes of crude \noil and coal recorded an increase. Reflecting \nlower economic activities, expenditure on most \nother intermediate goods declined in 2023. \nExpenditure on imports of investment goods \ndeclined with notable reductions in all three \nmain categories of investment goods, namely \nmachinery and equipment (mainly engineering \nequipment), building material (mainly iron and \nsteel), and transport equipment, and most of \ntheir subcategories, in 2023 compared to 2022, \nmainly attributable to import restriction and \nlower levels of economic activity, especially in \nthe construction sector.\nTerms of Trade\nThe terms of trade, which is the ratio of \nexport prices to import prices, deteriorated \nmarginally in 2023. Export price and import \nprice indices declined by 11.3 per cent and \n10.8 per cent to 82.7 index points, and 96.6 \nindex points, respectively, causing the terms of \ntrade to deteriorate by 0.6 per cent in 2023 \ncompared to 2022. The decline in the price \nindices of industrial exports and mineral exports \ncontributed to the decline in export prices, while \nlower prices of the importation of intermediate \ngoods and investment goods, accounted for \nthe decline in the overall import price index. \nThe volume indices for all main categories of \nexports deteriorated, except industrial exports, \nwhereas the import volume indices of all main \ncategories, except for consumer goods, showed \nimprovement during 2023. \nDirection of Trade\nBilateral trade with most major trading \npartners declined significantly, in line with \nlower total trade in 2023. India continued \nto be the major trading partner of Sri Lanka, \nfollowed by China and the USA. Accordingly, \nthese three key trading partners together \ncontributed to around 37 per cent of the total \ntrade of Sri Lanka in 2023.

The Office also spearheaded \nthe combined efforts of several line agencies \nto conclude negotiations of the SLTFTA in \nan expeditious manner. The Department \nof Commerce took necessary steps for the \ncontinuation of GSP schemes and other existing \nFTAs, while supporting trade negotiation \nprocesses. The Export Development Board \n(EDB) launched the National Export Brand \n\u201cYour Vital Island - Sri Lanka\u201d in November \n2023 to position Sri Lanka as a recognised \nsourcing destination to increase exports. The \nimplementation period of the National Export \nStrategy (NES) expired at end 2022 and a \nrevitalisation of the NES project is currently in \nprogress. Meanwhile, Sri Lanka Customs (SLC) \ninitiated its Strategic Plan for 2024-2028, \nfocusing on four strategic areas: revenue, \ntrade facilitation, eco-social protection, and \norganisational development. To create a more \nfavourable environment for investment and \nexport promotion, the Cabinet of Ministers \ngranted approval in November 2023 to \nestablish the Sri Lanka Economic Commission \nwith the expectation to consolidate the Board \nof Investment (BOI) and the EDB. Meanwhile, \nto provide the overall policy direction, a new \nNational Trade Policy is being drafted by the \nMinistry of Trade, Commerce and Food Security. \nSuch initiatives are key for the sustainable \ndevelopment of the tradable sector of the \neconomy.\nServices Account\nThe surplus in the services account recorded \na notable increase in 2023.

However, exports under the \nGlobal System of Trade Preference (GSTP) \nincreased, driven by cinnamon exports to \nMexico, and exports under the South Asian Free \nTrade Area (SAFTA) increased due to pepper \nexports to India. Negotiations on a Preferential \nTrade Agreement (PTA) with Bangladesh \ncompleted 4 rounds, while negotiations on \nseveral other PTAs with Indonesia, Malaysia, \nand Vietnam are in the pipeline. In other trade \nrelated arrangements, the 14th US-Sri Lanka \nTrade and Investment Framework Agreement \n(TIFA) Council Meeting was held in September \n2023 in Colombo, while in October 2023, \nSri Lanka assumed the chairmanship of Indian \nOcean Rim Association (IORA) for the period \n2023 to 2025. \nDespite the subdued performance of \ngarment exports, and other major export \nitems to the EU, the UK, and the USA, \nSri Lanka continued to benefit from the \nGeneralised System of Preference (GSP) \nschemes offered by these key trading \npartners. The EU GSP scheme was set to expire \non 31 December 2023 with a proposed new \nEU GSP+ 10-year scheme to be in effect from \n01 January 2024 until 31 December 2033, \nwhich contains six additional International \nConventions, that Sri Lanka has already ratified. \nHowever, in September 2023, the European \nCommission extended the validity period of \nthe current EU GSP scheme until the end of \n2027. The new GSP Scheme of the UK named \n\u201cDeveloping Countries Trading Scheme\u201d (DCTS) \ncame into effect in June 2023, under which \nSri Lanka would benefit from its Enhanced \nPreferences Scheme for 3 years.

Despite \nan increase in the dividends paid out by direct \ninvestment enterprises (DIEs) during the year, an \nincrease was observed in reinvested earnings \nin 2023 compared to 2022. However, interest \npayments on account of debt securities remained \nat similar levels.

Increased \nworkers\u2019 remittances were supported by the \ncontinued departures for foreign employment \nabroad. Increased inflows through official \nchannels, supported by the correction in the \nlarge disparity that prevailed between the \nofficial exchange rate and informal rates, also \nsupported the improved levels of remittances. \nHence, workers\u2019 remittances increased notably \nby 57.5 per cent to US dollars 5,970 million in \n2023, compared to US dollars 3,789 million \nin 2022. Consequently, the secondary income \naccount recorded a surplus of US dollars 5,619 \nmillion in 2023, compared to US dollars 3,496 \nmillion in 2022.\nCapital Account Balance\nNet inflows to the capital account increased \nin 2023. Capital transfers to both the \nGovernment and private sector increased in \n2023, with capital grants to the Government \nremaining modest.

In \nSeptember 2022, the IMF staff and the Sri Lankan \nauthorities reached a staff level agreement for a \n48-month arrangement under the EFF amounting \nto SDR 2.286 billion (about US dollars 3 billion). \nSubsequently, on 20 March 2023, the Executive \nBoard of the IMF approved the EFF as budget \nsupport to assist Sri Lanka\u2019s economic policies \nand reforms denoting the commencement of \nthe seventeenth IMF programme in Sri Lanka. \nAccordingly, the first and second tranches of the \nIMF-EFF totaling SDR 508 million (about  \nUS dollars 670 million) were disbursed in March \nand December 2023, respectively. The IMF and \nrelevant authorities regularly monitor the progress \nunder the EFF in terms of Quantitative Performance \nCriteria (QPCs), Continuous Performance Criteria \n(CPCs), Monetary Policy Consultative Clause \n(MPCC), Indicative Targets (ITs), and Structural \nBenchmarks (SBs) as set out in the EFF programme. \nAchievement of these targets on behalf of Sri Lanka \nis the responsibility of the Government and the \nCentral Bank. In terms of performance, all QPCs \nand ITs for end December 2023 were met except \nfor the IT on social spending, while most SBs falling \ndue before end February 2024 were either met or \nimplemented with delay. On 21 March 2024, a \nstaff level agreement was reached on economic \npolicies to conclude the second review of the IMF-\nEFF programme. Once the review is approved by \nthe IMF Executive Board, Sri Lanka will have access \nto a further SDR 254 million (about US dollars 337 \nmillion) in financing. \nTo restore macroeconomic stability and public debt \nsustainability in Sri Lanka, the IMF-EFF programme \nwas designed as a comprehensive economic reform \nprogramme that rests on several key pillars. These \npillars include revenue based fiscal consolidation, \na stronger social safety net to protect the most \nvulnerable, a sovereign debt restructuring strategy \naimed at restoring public debt sustainability, a \nmulti-pronged strategy to restore price stability \nand rebuild international reserves under greater \nexchange rate flexibility, policies to safeguard \nfinancial stability, focused reforms to address \ngovernance and corruption vulnerabilities, and \ngrowth enhancing broader structural reforms.\nThe key targets and elements of the current IMF-\nEFF programme, are discussed below. \nNet International Reserves (NIR) Target\nThe NIR target is a QPC under EFF to gauge \nthe reserve level maintained by the Central Bank \nexcluding the reserve related liabilities. The \nreserves remained at depleted levels in 2022 and \nearly 2023 as GOR declined notably, due to the \ncontinued moderation of inflows to the financial \naccount, external debt service payments to the \nmultilateral creditors, and net sales to the domestic \nforeign exchange market by the Central Bank \nprimarily for importation of essential imports during \nthe year.

The MPCC has been set to closely \nmonitor the developments in inflation to ensure that \nSri Lanka achieves the targeted level of inflation \nin line with its objective of maintaining domestic \nprice stability. It monitors quarterly inflation on \npredetermined target dates. Accordingly, quarterly \naverage year-on-year inflation calculated based \non the Colombo Consumer Price Index (CCPI) \n(2021=100), as per the method specified in the \nTechnical Memorandum of Understanding (TMU) \nof the IMF Staff Report was at 3.0 per cent by \nDecember 2023. Hence, realised inflation by \nDecember 2023 was within the lower outer band of \nMPCC of 2.0-3.5 per cent.\nPrimary Balance Target, Revenue, and Overall \nBudget Balance \nSri Lanka\u2019s central government revenue collection \nis identified to be one of the lowest in the world \nand has led to significant primary balance deficits \nhistorically. The IMF-EFF programme requires \nSri Lanka to implement revenue based fiscal \nconsolidation measures and introduce reforms \nto social safety nets, fiscal institutions, and State \nOwned Enterprises (SOEs) that are aimed at \nenhancing the efficiency and reducing the burden \non government coffers. Supported by stringent fiscal \nconsolidation efforts, the Government achieved \na primary surplus in 2023, which is well over \nthe primary deficit target set under the IMF-EFF \nfor 2023. Meanwhile, the overall budget deficit \nfor 2023 improved as a result of the significant \nincrease in revenue despite an increase in \ngovernment expenditure. \nIn addition, the central government tax revenue is \nspecified as an indicative target under the IMF-\nEFF programme. During the recently concluded \nprogramme review mission of the IMF, the notable \nimprovement in tax revenue collection was \ncommended. \nContinuous Performance Criteria (CPCs) and \nIndicative Targets (ITs)\nThe IMF-EFF programme has specified two CPCs. \nThese include (i) non-accumulation of new external \npayments arrears by the nonfinancial public sector \nand the Central Bank and (ii) no new Central \nBank purchases of government securities in the \nprimary market. These CPCs have been met by \nthe Sri Lankan authorities so far. In addition, the \nprogramme has specified ITs related to central \ngovernment tax revenue, social spending by the \ncentral government, cost of non-commercial \nobligations (NCOs) for fuel and electricity, and \nTreasury guarantees. All ITs except for social \nspending by the central government have been met \nunder the programme as of December 2023.    \nProgress on Debt Restructuring \nThe Government has been engaging with the \nexternal creditors to negotiate relief on external \ndebt with the intention of bringing down the debt \ntrajectory towards a sustainable path as envisaged \nby the IMF-EFF arrangement. There is significant \nprogress in the external debt restructuring process. \nIn November 2023, an agreement in principle was \nreached between the authorities and the Official \nCreditors Committee (OCC) and a preliminary \nagreement with the China EXIM Bank and Sri \nLanka was also reached to restructure its claims \non Sri Lanka. Currently, Sri Lanka is engaging \nclosely with OCC and China EXIM Bank to reach \ndebt agreements consistent with the programme \nparameters and in a comparable manner. Sri Lanka \nis also engaging closely with external commercial \ncreditors in good faith through continuous \ndialogues and information sharing, aiming to reach \na consensus on the debt treatment at the earliest.\nAdditionally, the Government launched its \nDomestic Debt Optimisation (DDO) programme \nin July 2023 and its key aspects were concluded \nin September 2023.

in Licensed Banks to Support \nSustainable Economic Recovery\nBackground \nThe challenging macroeconomic environment that \nprevailed during the recent years disrupted many \nbusiness entities limiting their income-generating \ncapabilities and hence forcing them to avoid making \ntimely payments of loans, which resulted in impairing \nthe recovery process of licensed banks (LBs)1. As \nevidenced by the increase of non-performing loans2 \nof LBs from 5.2 per cent at end-2019 to 13.6 \nper cent by the end of Quarter 3 in 2023, which \nmarginally improved later to 12.8 per cent by the \nend of 2023, the credit quality of the banking sector \nhas deteriorated significantly. The revival of such \nbusinesses would enhance economic activities and \nemployment opportunities and hence, contribute to \nthe rebound of the national economy.\nWith the negative impact of the Easter Sunday \nattacks in 2019, COVID-19 pandemic and adverse \nmacroeconomic conditions that prevailed during \nthe economic crisis, the Central Bank of Sri Lanka \n(CBSL) issued multiple guidelines from time to time \nto LBs to provide relief to the affected borrowers \nwhose debt servicing capacities were impaired. \nCurrently, LBs have established Post COVID-19 \nRevival Units, and it is a timely requirement for \nconsidering a more standardised framework with \nan enhanced scope in reviving fundamentally viable \nborrowers, by guiding LBs on eligibility criteria \nfor selection of borrowers, revival mechanisms, \ncorporate workout frameworks and governance \nframework.\nWith the onset of slowing down of economies owing \nto multiple reasons, the business revival frameworks \nbecame widely accepted in many countries. \nThe \u201cOut-of-Court Workouts\u201d are negotiated \nrestructurings between the borrower and lender/s \nwith or without the administrative guidelines. The \nmain advantages of \u201cOut-of-Court Workouts\u201d are \nthe expeditious implementation, relatively low-cost, \npreservation of confidentiality and greater flexibility \nwith respect to the terms and conditions of the \nrestructuring. \nAlternatively, some countries practice the business \nrevival processes through the involvement of judicial \nprocedures usually within the legal framework \nprovided by the insolvency laws.     \nBy considering the above factors, to facilitate the \nsustainable economic revival of businesses affected \nby the extraordinary macroeconomic circumstances \nand to ensure a transparent and effective resolution \npolicy framework on reviving the stressed borrowers \nof LBs, the CBSL issued a Circular in March 2024 on \n\u201cGuidelines for the Establishment of Business Revival \nUnits in Licensed Banks\u201d. The Circular includes broad \nguidelines to give effect to further strengthen the \nalready established Post COVID-19 Revival Units \nof LBs on Governance Framework and Resources, \nEligibility Criteria for Selection of Borrowers, Revival \nMechanisms, Framework for Corporate Workouts, \nAccounting Considerations and Regulatory Reporting.\nObjectives of Establishing Business Revival Units \nin Licensed Banks\nThe purpose of Business Revival Units is to identify \nand assist performing and non-performing borrowers \nof LBs who are facing challenges or may face \npotential financial (and/or business) difficulties due to \na reduction of income, cash flows or sales, reduction \nor impairment of business operations or temporary \nclosure of business emanating from extraordinary \nmacroeconomic circumstances. \nThe Unit aims to revive businesses that are facing \nactual or potential financial difficulties but are \nfundamentally viable, intending to provide benefits \nto such borrowers, leading to the revival of such \nbusinesses, enhancing economic activities and \ncontributing to the development of the national \neconomy.\nGovernance and Operational Framework of \nBusiness Revival Units\nWith a view to reviving viable businesses of \nborrowers of banks, LBs shall formulate a revival \nand rehabilitation policy for borrowers who are \nfacing actual or potential financial difficulties but are \nfundamentally viable, and these policies need to be \nreviewed and updated, at least annually. \nA Business Revival Unit is expected to work in an \norderly and an independent manner with Loan \nOrigination, Legal, Risk Management and Credit \nEnforcement units to ensure that all relevant \ninformation and system access for the loans that may \nfall under the purview of the Business Revival Unit are \nshared effectively. Further, LBs are required to provide \nthe necessary staff and other resources to establish \nBusiness Revival Units, and LBs whose operations \nare geographically spread across the island are", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4745, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "048d2097-e5ca-4dee-b42a-e39347d3b0d1": {"__data__": {"id_": "048d2097-e5ca-4dee-b42a-e39347d3b0d1", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "79", "file_name": "economy_review.pdf", "file_path": "/home/lahiru-menik/Documents/Tutorial/RAG-Tutorial/data/economy_review.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9788570, "creation_date": "2025-02-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "2813cb55-2810-452c-a163-5f2cc928300b", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "79", "file_name": "economy_review.pdf", "file_path": "/home/lahiru-menik/Documents/Tutorial/RAG-Tutorial/data/economy_review.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9788570, "creation_date": "2025-02-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-15"}, "hash": "b066795f41b9d2de7704a4c2f9b2cf1952b3943134245e0b94c3bf3310a0cd6f", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL ECONOMIC REVIEW 2023\n1\n58\nencouraged to have the units regionally, based on \nthe effectiveness of the operation.\nFundamental viability assessment will be a crucial \ntask under the business revival process as the \nviability assessment procedures should be both \neffective and transparent. Under the fundamental \nviability assessment, both quantitative and qualitative \nindicators will be considered on a prudential basis. \nThese indicators may include the assessment \nregarding the profitability, leverage, liquidity, \nmaturity profile of liabilities and other relevant \nqualitative criteria. The viability assessment, to the \nextent possible, needs to be based on the audited \nfinancial statements of the borrower. However, in \nthe absence of audited financial statements for the \nborrower owing to justifiable reasons, LBs may use \nappropriate and credible sources of information \nat the discretion of the bank. In this regard, it will \nbe important for LBs to ensure that borrowers \nare cooperative, as LBs will consider only such \nborrowers for revival.\nFurther, LBs are encouraged to disclose their \ngovernance framework, operational procedures and \nviability assessment methodologies in their Annual \nReport or any other published reports to enhance \naccountability and transparency. \nRevival Mechanisms: Financial and Operational\nThe Business Revival Unit shall use financial and/ or \noperational restructuring tools and techniques or any \ncombination thereof to revive distressed but viable \nbusinesses. \n\uf0a7 Financial restructuring tools would include debt \nforgiveness, debt rescheduling including grace \nperiods for the payment of principal and interest, \nadjustment of interest rates, maturity extensions, \nand provision of new financing, including interim \nfinancing and exit financing. \n\uf0a7 Under operational restructuring, the Business \nRevival Unit may consider proposing fundamental \nchanges in the business\u2019s operations or assets to \nrestore commercial viability, developing a new \nbusiness plan/strategy, and enhancing operational \nefficiency and profitability of such businesses, \nimproving cash management systems, reviewing \npricing strategy, and reviewing customer retention \nand/or acquisition strategies. Moreover, the \nUnit may also conduct awareness programmes \non rehabilitation initiatives, and provide credit \ncounselling and business advisory services, in \nreaching out to potential investors. \nA Framework for Corporate Workouts\nUnder the business revival process a Framework \nfor Corporate Workouts is a newly introduced \nmechanism as an overarching framework for a \nmutually agreeable business revival plan between \na borrower and multiple banks as creditors. Since \nthis is a mutual agreement between parties, a court \nintervention would not be required. LBs may adopt \na collaborative approach to develop a common \nmodel for a Framework Agreement for Corporate \nWorkouts that will govern negotiations of a workout \nagreement between LBs and any eligible corporate \nborrower that seeks to avail of the Corporate \nWorkout Framework. Currently, a common model \nis being developed by LBs. Given due consideration \nto the possible complexities and cost involvement \nthat may arise in the process of negotiating \nmutually agreeable conditions, this framework is \nrecommended for corporate borrowers.\nWay Forward \nAs per the proposed business revival mechanism \nof LBs, it is expected that distressed borrowers who \nare engaged in business activities will be able to \nrevive their businesses with the guidance of LBs, and \nimproved cash flows will be utilised to repay their \nnon-performing loans and thereby improving asset \nquality of the banking sector.\nFurther, with the improvement in the macroeconomic \nenvironment of the country, the revival of businesses, \nespecially the Micro, Small & Medium Enterprises \n(MSMEs), would promote sustainable economic \ngrowth and employment opportunities and hence, \ncontribute to the sustained development of the \nnational economy. In addition, the other measures, \nwhich are in progress, such as establishment of \nNational Credit Guarantee Institution (NCGI), \nimplementation of an enhanced legal framework \nthrough the Secured Transactions Act and the \nexpansion of MSME definition to cover a wide scale \nof businesses will be conducive to revive the affected \nbusinesses and accordingly, to contribute the \nenhancement of economic activities. 1\nNotes\n1.

Daily average transaction value in the \ncall money market decreased to Rs. 8.6 billion \nin 2023 from Rs. 15.7 billion in 2022. However, \ndaily average transaction value in the repo \nmarket increased to Rs. 14.4 billion in 2023 \nfrom Rs. 6.8 billion in 2022 indicating increased \npreference for collateralised lending by financial \ninstitutions. \nDomestic Foreign Exchange Market\nThe rupee appreciated by 12.1 per cent \nagainst the US dollar during 2023. The \nUSD/LKR exchange rate, which was 363.11 at \nend 2022, was at 323.92 at end 2023. The \nCentral Bank has allowed the exchange rate to \nbe determined by market forces since 07 March \n2023.

However, Central \nBank interventions in the FX market reduced \nthe pressure on the rupee, and the exchange \nrate stabilised. Further, trading volumes in the \ndomestic FX inter-bank market increased by \n56.7 per cent to US dollars 15.0 billion in 2023 \ncompared to US dollars 9.6 billion recorded in \n2022.\nGovernment Securities Market\nIn line with policy rate reductions, secondary \nmarket yields also decreased resulting in \na downward shift in the yield curve. The \nsecondary market yield curve indicated signs \ntransitioning to the regular shaped curve \nby the end of 2023. Further, liquidity in the \nsecondary market of government securities \nmarginally improved during 2023 which was \nobserved through increased daily average \ntrade volumes and daily average number \nof trades in the market. Accordingly, during \n2023 daily average trade volumes and daily \naverage number of trades increased to Rs 25.7 \nbillion and 80.6 respectively, from Rs 12.5 \nbillion and 39 recorded in 2022. However, the \nsecondary market transactions were skewed \ntowards short term maturities.

Transactions carried out \nthrough the Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) \nsystem, which enables large value transactions \nfor individuals and corporates, as well as \ninterbank transactions, continued to increase. \nDue to the significant improvement in market \nliquidity observed in 2023, transactions related \nto the Intraday Liquidity Facility, which facilitates \nparticipants intraday liquidity requirements for \nRTGS operations and the Standing Lending \nFacility, which is settled through the RTGS \nsystem, decreased in both value and volume. \nFurther, embarking on a policy of regional \nintegration of payment systems, LANKAQR was \nintegrated with Unified Payments Interface (UPI) \nin India and UnionPay International in China in \n2023, enabling visitors using those systems to \nseamlessly pay via LANKAQR in Sri Lanka.\nThe Central Bank ensured payment and \nsettlement systems stability via closely \nmonitoring market trends, taking swift policy \ndecisions when necessary and increasing \nstakeholder awareness as appropriate to \nmitigate the emerging risks in the payment \nsector in the country.

Hence, financial \nauthorities around the world have been compelled \nto reinforce and reshape the scope and approaches \nto the financial system oversight function with an \nincreased focus on widening financial inclusion \nand strengthening the financial consumer \nprotection provided to the financial consumers by \nFinancial Service Providers (FSPs). In this context, \nstrengthening the financial consumer protection \nframework through effective regulations, supervision, \nand consumer empowerment is becoming one of \nthe priorities of financial authorities worldwide. \nFor example, as per the 2022 Global State of \nFinancial Inclusion and Consumer Protection \nSurvey conducted by the World Bank, out of 113 \nresponded jurisdictions, 109 jurisdictions have \nregulations on financial consumer protection.\nMarket Conduct Supervision\nMarket Conduct Supervision (MCS) is one of the \npillars of financial consumer protection and is used \nby regulators in achieving the overarching goal \nof market integrity and trust among depositors, \nborrowers, investors, stakeholders, and the public, \ncontributing to financial system stability and \neconomic growth. A comprehensive or full scope \nMCS involves a continuous review of FSPs' products, \nservices, systems and procedures, and practices \nwith prompt corrective and enforcement actions. \nDespite some similarities in its goals, approach \nprocess, MCS is different from prudential supervision \nof financial institutions in terms of its concepts and \nfocus areas and tries to provide fair outcomes for \nboth financial consumers and FSPs. \nMCS Approaches \nAs MCS is designed and implemented under \ndifferent operating environments and structures, \ntwo main approaches can be adapted to suit the \nregulatory objectives, resources, and skill levels \nas well as the development of the industry and \neconomy as a whole. In a compliance-based \napproach, supervisors focus on non-compliance with \nlaws and regulations of FSPs and take appropriate \nenforcement actions to ensure full compliance. In \nthe risk-based approach, supervisors focus on risk \nanalysis and mitigations. Accordingly, the risk-based \napproach of MCS is more forward looking and the \nsupervisory activities are fine tuned according to the \nrisk levels identified prior and during the supervisory \ncycle.    \nMain Supervisory Tools \nMCS encompasses a range of supervisory tools \nsuch as media watch and product reviews, \nthematic reviews, mystery shopping and calls, self-\nassessments by FSPs and direct engagement with \nFSP leadership focusing on market conduct risks \nand controls to emerging issues, validating specific \npractices, and gauging control adequacy. These \ntools collectively facilitate supervisors to have an \neffective MCS.  \nThe Market Conduct Supervision of the Central \nBank\nPursuing the development of global financial \nconsumer protection regulations, the Central Bank \nestablished the Financial Consumer Relations \nDepartment (FCRD) in 2020 and issued the \nRegulations on Financial Consumer Protection, \nNo. 01 of 2023, under Section 10(c) of the then \nMonetary Law Act in August 2023, covering \nall financial institutions under its purview. The \nRegulations, which will be fully effective from August \n2024, integrate and strengthen the existing customer \nprotection frameworks issued under different statutes \nand empower the Central Bank to supervise the \nmarket conduct of FSPs regulated by it.  \nFigure\nB 4.1\nThe Market Conduct Supervision\nProcess\nSource: Central Bank of Sri Lanka\nMarket Monitoring\nPre-Planning\nReporting, Monitoring &\nEnforcement\nOnsite Examination\n1.

As a precursor to MCS, FCRD \nconducted a thematic review on the complaint \nhandling mechanism of FSPs. The assessment \nhelped set the background for the MCS process \nwhile providing an opportunity for FSPs to improve \ntheir internal redress mechanism.  \nConclusion and Way Forward\nAs countries navigate through increased risk \nand complexities of modern financial products \nand services, upholding public confidence in the \nfinancial system is a key element in achieving \nfinancial inclusiveness and system stability. A robust \nMCS as the main mechanism in regulating financial \nconsumer protection always fosters fair treatment for \nfinancial consumers and responsible market conduct \nof FSPs. This will pave the way for increased public \ntrust in the overall financial system.\nIn this regard, the Central Bank is developing \nthe necessary mechanisms, competencies, and \nprocedures for conducting MCS of FSPs  in \nterms of the Regulations No. 01 of 2023. As \nof 2023, the Central Bank has developed a \nmarket conduct supervisory manual integrating \nits supervisory approach, tools, and process with \nrequired details and is expected to commence \nthe first full scope MCS during second half of \n2024. Going forward, the Central Bank expects \nto have greater co-operation from market conduct \nsupervisors in other countries and international \nnetworks such as Alliance for Financial Inclusion \n(AFI) and the International Financial Consumer \nProtection Organisation (FinCoNet) to gain \nnecessary experience and expertise for effective \nimplementation of MCS contributing to a more \nresilient and stable financial system upholding the \ntrust and confidence of the financial consumers. 1  \nReferences\n1.

Meanwhile, expenditure on pension \npayments rose considerably during 2023, with \nthe increased retirements during the year due \nto revisions implemented in the preceding year \nin relation to reducing retirement age for public \nsector employees from 65 to 60. Further, free \nmedicine, and implementation of the Aswesuma \nWelfare Benefit Scheme contributed for the \nincrease in subsidies and transfers. On the other \nhand, salaries and wages declined marginally \nin nominal terms as well as in GDP terms, as \na result of freezing of new recruitments to the \npublic sector and sizeable retirements of public \nservants from the workforce. Meanwhile, capital \nexpenditure and net lending recorded a notable \ndecline both in nominal terms as well as GDP \nterms. This reduction was primarily attributed to \na significant decrease in net lending, caused by \nthe settlement of the on-lending facility provided \nto CPC in 2022 through the Indian Credit Line. \nCapital expenditure excluding the impact of \nnet lending as a percentage of GDP increased \nto 3.3 per cent in 2023 from 3.0 per cent in \n2022. According to the initial budget estimates \nMeanwhile, non-tax revenue also increased \nduring 2023 both in nominal and real terms, \nmainly driven by higher revenue collection from \nsources such as fees and charges, as well as \nprofit and dividend transfers from State Owned \nEnterprises (SOEs). According to the initial \nbudget estimates for 2023, total revenue was \nprojected to be 12.5 per cent of GDP, with tax \nrevenue and non-tax revenue estimated at 11.3 \nper cent and 1.2 per cent of GDP, respectively. \nDespite the notable improvement in revenue \ncollection in 2023 compared to the previous \nyear, there was an underperformance of revenue \nrelative to the initial ambitious budget estimates \nfor 2023. The realised revenue for 2023 \namounted to 88.4 per cent, with realised tax \nrevenue standing at 86.9 per cent of the initial \nprojections. This shortfall could be attributed to \nfaster deceleration in inflation than anticipated in \nthe budget, continued subdued import demand, \nexchange rate appreciation, and issues related \nto revenue administration. Tax measures such as \nthe upward revisions to the income tax structure \nhave led to an increase in the share of direct \ntax collection, reaching 33.5 per cent in 2023 \ncompared to 30.5 per cent in 2022.\nThe total expenditure and net lending \nincreased both in nominal terms and as a \npercentage of GDP, mainly driven by the \nsubstantial escalation in domestic interest \nexpenditure, despite the notable reduction \nin capital expenditure and net lending. \nAccordingly, in nominal terms, government \nexpenditure recorded a year-on-year growth of \n19.8 per cent, while in GDP terms expenditure \nincreased only by 0.8 percentage points in \n2023. The significant nominal rise in domestic \ninterest expenditure was influenced by elevated \ndomestic interest rates stemming from tight \nmonetary conditions prevailed until June 2023 \nand high risk premia attached to government \nsecurities amidst uncertainties over DDO.

Although this share has slightly reduced \ncompared to the past two years, where it \nexceeded 100 per cent in 2021, the current \npercentage still remains relatively high in \ncomparison to the 62.3 per cent and 57.5 per \ncent recorded for 2019 and 2018, respectively, \nwhen similar restrictions were not in effect. Once \nthe impact of the transactions in relation to \nthe DDO operation is eliminated, the total net \ndomestic financing was predominantly sourced \nthrough Treasury bills, reflecting a strong market \npreference for short term instruments over long \nterm instruments due to uncertainties and higher \nTreasury bill rates prevailed during the first \nhalf of the year.28  In 2023, net financing from \nTreasury bills amounted to 7.5 per cent of GDP  \n(Rs. 2,058.6 billion), up from 6.7 per cent of \nGDP (Rs. 1,608.2 billion) recorded in 2022. \nConversely, net financing from Treasury bonds \n28 During the year, Sri Lanka Development Bonds and Central Bank Provisional Ad-\nvances were settled as part of the DDO operation.\ndecreased to 2.5 per cent of GDP (Rs. 692.3 \nbillion) in 2023, down from 6.0 per cent of GDP  \n(Rs. 1,440.2 billion) in 2022. Net domestic \nfinancing from the banking sector experienced \na significant contraction, with a net prepayment \nof 0.02 per cent of GDP (Rs. 6.4 billion).29 This \nreduction was offset by non-bank sources, which \naccounted for 6.5 per cent of GDP (Rs. 1,798.5 \nbillion) in 2023. Meanwhile, the share of net \nforeign financing in total net financing increased \nto 21.7 per cent in 2023, in comparison to \n17.3 per cent in the preceding year. The net \nforeign financing in 2023 includes gross funds \nreceived under the two tranches of the IMF-EFF \nfacility, which was granted as budget support. \nAdditionally, notable receipts were received from \nother multilateral agencies such as ADB and \nthe International Development Association (IDA) \nof the World Bank. These funds were provided \nin support of the Government's economic \nstabilisation programme and to support \nexpenditure on social safety nets.\nSovereign rating agencies maintained their \ndowngraded rating status for Sri Lanka due \nto the standstill on selected foreign debt \nservice payments. Accordingly, Fitch Ratings \nand S&P Global Ratings maintained the long \nterm foreign currency Issuer Default Rating (IDR) \nfor Sri Lanka at RD (Restricted Default) and SD \n(Selective Default), respectively. Moody\u2019s Ratings \nmaintained the long term foreign currency issuer \ncredit rating at 'Ca' (Stable). In the meantime, \nthe announcement of the DDO operation \nprompted the international sovereign credit \nrating agencies to downgrade the ratings of \nlocal currency domestic debt of the Government, \nwhile the same were upgraded with the \nsuccessful completion of the DDO operation. \n29 In contrast to the contraction recorded in net domestic financing from the banking \nsector under this section, NCG figures given under the Monetary Sector Develop-\nments of this Chapter show an expansion. This discrepancy can be attributed to the \ntiming of recording the debt transfer associated with CPC's public guaranteed debt \nto the central government debt stock which was accounted for in the banking sector \nrecords only in 2023, despite being transferred by end 2022 as per the records of \nMinistry of Finance.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4250, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "22c99826-81e2-4bc3-a811-bd9088bf9055": {"__data__": {"id_": "22c99826-81e2-4bc3-a811-bd9088bf9055", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "95", "file_name": "economy_review.pdf", "file_path": "/home/lahiru-menik/Documents/Tutorial/RAG-Tutorial/data/economy_review.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9788570, "creation_date": "2025-02-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "c4b279b4-bdef-4c42-b302-acf17d439920", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "95", "file_name": "economy_review.pdf", "file_path": "/home/lahiru-menik/Documents/Tutorial/RAG-Tutorial/data/economy_review.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9788570, "creation_date": "2025-02-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-15"}, "hash": "72bfc5a7ca360fa9c31d5a3c3682c113fcacbe6b01e168b2d33758d605e690bc", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "b0ee6a4e-8b8c-4375-a363-0e96a9d3204f", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "eced38cacb5d862a0ed1ae583789dcbba7b6ad7b1e25b5f862cd257e00231214", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "CENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA | ANNUAL ECONOMIC REVIEW 2023\n1\n74\n1.6.4 Central Government Debt   \n and Public Debt 30 \nCentral government debt as a percentage \nof GDP declined to 103.9 per cent by end \n2023 from 114.2 per cent in 2022, primarily \ndue to the notable growth in nominal GDP \ndriven by high inflation and the impact \nof currency appreciation on foreign debt. \nAccordingly, domestic debt and foreign debt as \na percentage of GDP declined from 62.5 per \ncent and 51.8 per cent, respectively, in 2022 to \n61.7 per cent and 42.1 per cent, respectively, \nin 2023.31 However, nominal value of the total \ndebt32 increased by 4.4 per cent driven solely \nby a rise in domestic debt, while outstanding \nforeign debt, valued in domestic currency, \ndecreased from the levels observed in 2022. \nThe nominal increase in total domestic debt \nreflects the substantial financing needs fulfilled \nfrom the domestic market amidst limited foreign \nfinancing options.

CBA stipulates price stability as the prime \nobjective of the Central Bank and financial stability as the other objective. It recognises Flexible \nInflation Targeting (FIT) as the monetary policy framework supported by a flexible exchange rate \nregime. Moreover, the Central Bank has been designated as the macroprudential authority.

The crisis response and prudent policy measures implemented by \nthe Central Bank and the Government, supported by the IMF-EFF programme, helped restore \nmacroeconomic stability to a great extent in 2023. On the monetary front, in view of benevolent \ninflation developments and improvements in the external sector, there was a shift from a \ntight monetary policy stance to an accommodative stance since June 2023. The imposition \nof interest rate caps on selected lending products, effective monetary policy communication \namidst uncertainty, and measures taken to improve liquidity conditions in the market resulted \nin accelerated monetary policy transmission and a notable downward adjustment in market \ninterest rates by end 2023. Showing signs of spillover of easing monetary conditions to the real \neconomy, a reversal of the trend of private sector credit contraction was observed since June \n2023. On the external front, the Central Bank, having discontinued the daily guidance given to \nthe market since mid-2022, allowed greater flexibility in the determination of the exchange rate \nin March 2023. In line with improved foreign exchange liquidity in the market, the exchange \nrate was allowed to be determined by market forces thereafter. Intervention by the Central \nBank in the domestic foreign exchange market was only aimed at preventing any unwarranted \nexcessive volatility and accumulating Gross Official Reserves (GOR). Reflecting the improved \nexternal sector position and the return of confidence, the Sri Lanka rupee appreciated, while \nGOR improved notably. In the meantime, the majority of the administrative controls that the \nCentral Bank and the Government had put in place during the foreign exchange crunch were \nprogressively loosened in 2023.

The notable moderation \nof inflation and well anchored inflation \nexpectations, subpar economic activity amidst \nsubdued domestic demand conditions, and the \neasing of external sector pressures paved the \nway for the Central Bank to pursue a relaxed \nmonetary policy stance during the year. As \ninflation peaked in September 2022, in line \nwith the anticipated disinflation trajectory, \nthe Central Bank initiated moral suasion to \nreduce interest rates from their peak levels in \nlate 2022. Despite the gradual moderation \nof excessive market interest rates from late \n2022, the Central Bank was compelled to \nraise policy interest rates, i.e., the Standing \nDeposit Facility Rate (SDFR) and the Standing \nLending Facility Rate (SLFR) by 100 basis points \nin early March 2023 to fulfil the \u2018prior action\u2019 \nthat was required to be met to finalise the \nInternational Monetary Fund - Extended Fund \nFacility (IMF-EFF) arrangement. However, the \nmagnitude of this increase was notably below \nthe level of adjustment envisioned in the initial \nround of negotiations. Despite this increase \nin policy interest rates, active communication \nby the Central Bank alleviated the impact of \nsuch increase on market interest rates. Upon \nobserving signs of a sustained moderation of \ninflation, the Central Bank commenced easing \nmonetary policy in early June 2023, and policy \ninterest rates were reduced by a total of 650 \nbasis points over four occasions during the year. \nConsidering the somewhat sluggish downward \nadjustment in overall market lending interest \nrates, caps on interest rates of selected lending \nproducts were imposed by the Central Bank \nin late August 2023, forcing a reduction in \nexcessive interest rates of those products in line \nwith the accommodative monetary policy stance. \nIn order to induce a downward adjustment in \noverall market interest rates on rupee loans \nand advances, broader guidelines were issued \nfor banks requiring lending interest rates to be \nreduced by at least 350 basis points by end \n2023 compared to the levels that prevailed at \nend July 2023. These measures were reinforced \nin frequent dialogue with the banking sector \nto ensure that overall market lending interest \nrates declined to levels consistent with the policy \ninterest rates. In March 2024, measures were \ntaken to loosen monetary policy further by \nway of reducing the policy interest rates by 50 \nbasis points, which is expected to support credit \ngrowth and revival of economic activity through \nthe expected further reduction in market lending \ninterest rates in the backdrop of low inflation.\nMeasures were taken to improve liquidity \nconditions in the domestic money market \nin 2023. Overall liquidity in the domestic \nmoney market remained largely at deficit levels \nduring the period leading up to August 2023, \nwhich is expected to have hindered the effective \ntransmission of monetary policy easing measures \nto market interest rates. Accordingly, in line \nwith the easing of the monetary policy stance, \nthe Central Bank implemented several policy \nmeasures to address the persistent liquidity deficit \nin the domestic money market.

Furthermore, as a precaution, \nthe Central Bank strengthened its Emergency \nLiquidity Assistance (ELA) Framework enabling it \nto provide funds to licensed banks in the event of \nany imminent financial panic. The Central Bank \nalso conducted active open market operations \n(OMOs) injecting liquidity on a term basis \nthrough term reverse repo auctions as needed in \naddition to the overnight reverse repo auctions. \nMoreover, with a view to injecting liquidity on a \npermanent basis, auctions for outright purchase \nof Treasury bonds were conducted in 2023, \nwhich followed into the first few weeks of 2024. \nMeasures were also taken to reactivate \nthe money markets by reducing LCBs\u2019 \noverreliance on the overnight funding \nfacilities of the Central Bank. With effect from \n16 January 2023, restrictions were imposed \non the accessibility of the standing facilities to \nLCBs. Accordingly, the usage of the Standing \nDeposit Facility (SDF) was limited to a maximum \nof five (05) times per calendar month, while \nthe Standing Lending Facility (SLF) was limited \nto 90 per cent of SRR of each LCB on any \ngiven day. These restrictions prompted licensed \nbanks to explore alternative options for liquidity \nmanagement. As a result, a reactivation in \ndomestic money market activity was observed, \nwhile LCBs reduced their reliance on Central \nBank facilities. In view of the improvements \nobserved in the money markets, steps were \ntaken to ease restrictions on the usage of the \nstanding facilities gradually, where the restriction \non SLF was removed, while the restriction on \nSDF was initially relaxed to ten (10) times during \na calendar month with effect from the reserve \nmaintenance period from mid-February 2024 \nand a policy decision was taken to remove it \ncompletely with effect from April 2024. \nSupported by the aforesaid monetary policy \nmeasures and operations, market interest \nrates eased, and overall credit conditions \nimproved in 2023. The Average Weighted Call \nMoney Rate (AWCMR), which is the short term \ninterest rate closely monitored by the Central \nBank as the operating target to guide the \nmarket interest rates under the FIT framework, \ndeclined towards the lower bound of the \nStanding Rate Corridor (SRC) during 2023. With \nthese developments and the finalisation of the \nDomestic Debt Optimisation (DDO) operation \nand the associated decline in risk premia, yields \non government securities declined significantly \nduring the year paving the way for the notable \nreduction in overall market interest rates.

Accordingly, \ncredit to the private sector, which suffered \ncontinued contractions since mid-2022, marked \na turnaround from June 2023, recording an \nexpansion of credit on a monthly basis until \nthe end of the year supporting the recovery \nof domestic economic activity. Despite the \nrecovery, credit to the private sector recorded a \ncontraction of 0.6 per cent, year-on-year, by end \n2023, as credit declined significantly during the \nperiod from January to May 2023.

At the same time, to build \nup the Gross Official Reserves (GOR), the \nCentral Bank\u2019s purchases of foreign exchange \nfrom the domestic foreign exchange market \ncontributed to enhancing the Net Foreign Assets \n(NFA) of the Central Bank.\nThe monetary policy communication \nstrategy of the Central Bank during 2023 \nwas focused on the continuation of the \ndisinflation process, reduction of market \ninterest rates in line with the reduced \nrisk premia following the DDO operation \nand effecting a faster transmission of the \naccommodative monetary policy stance \nduring the second half of the year. During \nthe first half of 2023, the Central Bank\u2019s \ncommunication strategy focused on ensuring \nthe continuation of the disinflation process \nby anchoring inflation expectations and \npersuading financial institutions to reduce the \nlarge spread between market interest rates and \npolicy interest rates, which was caused by the \nsubstantial premium that persisted on yields on \ngovernment securities amidst the uncertainties \nassociated with the DDO operation. During \nthe second half of the year, the Central Bank\u2019s \ncommunication was focused on expediting \nthe transmission of accommodative monetary \npolicy for the benefit of the masses. A mix of \nconventional channels and social media was \nused by the Central Bank to enhance monetary \npolicy communication during the year. Monetary \npolicy announcements were communicated \nvia press releases in all three languages, and \nthey were complemented by press conferences \nchaired by the Governor of the Central Bank. \nThese press conferences were livestreamed via \nsocial media, and important messages were \nmade available on the Central Bank\u2019s social \nmedia channels as short video snippets. The \npractice of publishing the inflation fan chart \nin the press releases on monetary policy and \ninflation was continued throughout the year, in \norder to guide the stakeholders of the economy \nabout the anticipated developments of inflation, \nthereby helping the anchoring of medium term \ninflation expectations. This approach marked \nan important development in the monetary \npolicy communication strategy of the Central \nBank, consistent with the FIT framework, where \nforward-looking information plays a major role. \nMeanwhile, the Governor and senior officials \nof the Central Bank participated in various \nevents and programmes to raise awareness \non monetary policy. Simultaneously, regular \npublications of the Central Bank, including \nthe Annual Report, were completed in a timely \nmanner. The publication of the first Monetary \nPolicy Report (MPR) of the Central Bank in July \n2023 marked an important step in the monetary \npolicy communication strategy of the Central \nBank. The main aim of this publication is to \ncommunicate the rationale for the monetary \npolicy decisions taken during the relevant \nperiod, thereby contributing to enhancing the \naccountability of monetary policymaking of the \nCentral Bank. In addition, MPR serves a key \npurpose in the FIT framework by providing an \nimportant means of communicating anticipated \ndevelopments of key macroeconomic variables, \nthereby helping the stakeholders of the economy \nto make informed economic decisions, \nincorporating forward-looking information. As \nper the statutory requirement in CBA, the Central \nBank is required to publish the MPR  \nbi-annually, and accordingly, the first MPR as a \nstatutory publication was published in February \n2024. Along with the publication of this MPR, \nshort non-technical video clips highlighting the \nkey messages of the publication were made \navailable via the Central Bank\u2019s social media \nchannels with the aim of improving the reach of \nthe content of the Report to a wider audience.

The \nCentral Bank allowed greater flexibility in the \ndetermination of exchange rate with effect \nfrom 07 March 2023 by discontinuing the \ndaily guidance given to the market since May \n2022, considering the improvement in the \nliquidity in the domestic foreign exchange \nmarket. Accordingly, the exchange rate was \nallowed to be determined based on the demand \nand supply conditions in the domestic foreign \nexchange market only with limited interventions \nby the Central Bank aimed at preventing any \nexcessive volatility in the exchange rate and \naccumulating GOR through purchases of \nforeign exchange from the market. Previously, \nduring 2021 and in early 2022, the Sri Lanka \nrupee was maintained at stable levels before \nbeing allowed a measured adjustment in the \nexchange rate in early March 2022. However, \nthe outcome of this adjustment fell short of \nexpectations due to the large overshooting of \nthe exchange rate. Accordingly, the Sri Lanka \nrupee depreciated significantly by end April \n2022. Due to this instability, the Central Bank \ncommenced providing daily market guidance \nto the interbank foreign exchange market from \n13 May 2022 onwards that helped stabilise the \nexchange rate from significant intraday volatility. \nThis was implemented by publishing a middle \nspot exchange rate and a variation margin on \neither side (+/-) of the middle spot exchange \nrate on a daily basis. The margin varied in a \nrange of Rs. 1.00 \u2013 Rs. 10.00 and was set either \nsymmetrically or asymmetrically on the middle \nspot exchange rate from time to time. With \nthese measures, greater stability of the exchange \nrate was observed during the period reflecting \nthe effectiveness of this policy. With a view to \nencouraging activity in the domestic foreign \nexchange market and restoring a market-driven \nexchange rate in line with its FIT framework, the \nCentral Bank commenced a gradual relaxation \nof the daily variation band, while loosening the \nmandatory sales requirement. By early March \n2023, the daily guidance given to the market \nwas discontinued while the policies relating to \nforex conversions implemented in 2022, such as \nthe mandatory requirement imposed on licensed \nbanks (to sell foreign exchange to the Central \nBank on a weekly basis) on account of converted \ninward workers\u2019 remittances and service \nsector related export receipts and the residual \nvalue of converted export proceeds of goods, \nwere revoked in March 2023. Accordingly, \nthe liquidity conditions and sentiments in the \ndomestic foreign exchange market improved \nnotably. Moreover, operating instructions issued \nin 2020 to licensed commercial banks on the \nInward Investments Swaps (IIS) Scheme were \nalso revoked in 2023. The above measures \nhelped improve foreign exchange liquidity \nconditions as well as market sentiments leading \nto appreciation of the Sri Lanka rupee in 2023.\nThe enactment of CBA reiterated the \nimportance of a flexible exchange rate \nregime to complement the FIT framework.\nAccording to CBA, the Central Bank is charged", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3969, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "b80de558-c6e1-4185-b22c-b9edb642944f": {"__data__": {"id_": "b80de558-c6e1-4185-b22c-b9edb642944f", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "104", "file_name": "economy_review.pdf", "file_path": "/home/lahiru-menik/Documents/Tutorial/RAG-Tutorial/data/economy_review.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9788570, "creation_date": "2025-02-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "d73c81fe-21be-4092-bd0e-6538d80ab7eb", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "104", "file_name": "economy_review.pdf", "file_path": "/home/lahiru-menik/Documents/Tutorial/RAG-Tutorial/data/economy_review.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9788570, "creation_date": "2025-02-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-15"}, "hash": "21dead4937941ba680e8a5f27f0e3529c9f7f112e34d4c047ad101961a64d474", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "83\nREVIEW OF CENTRAL BANK POLICIES\n2 2\nwith the implementation of a flexible exchange \nrate regime in line with the FIT framework in \norder to achieve and maintain domestic price \nstability. A flexible exchange rate regime is also \nexpected to foster a deeper and more liquid \nforeign exchange market. With the adoption \nof the flexible exchange rate policy mandated \nby CBA, the anti-export bias that prevailed in \nthe past through an overvalued currency would \nbe eliminated in the future and the exchange \nrate would move in line with the demand for \nand supply of foreign exchange in the domestic \nforeign exchange market. With the adoption \nof the flexible exchange rate policy, the market \nconfidence improved notably, resulting in \nsignificant net inflows to the domestic foreign \nexchange market. Consequently, the exchange \nrate appreciated against the US dollar by 12.1 \nper cent in 2023 and by 7.6 per cent by end \nMarch 2024 in line with market fundamentals. \nThese developments enabled the Central Bank \nto purchase, on a net basis (based on value \ndate), US dollars 1.7 billion in 2023 and around \nUS dollars 1.1 billion during the first quarter \nof 2024. Further, this policy will safeguard the \ncountry from the extreme impacts of external \nshocks to Sri Lanka, since the exchange rate \nwill be allowed to adjust in response to shocks, \nthus external sector stability will be restored \neventually through the Balance of Payments \n(BOP) adjustments.\n2.3.2 Exchange Restrictions and \nCapital Flow Management \nMeasures (CFMs)\nMost administrative measures introduced \nat the time of the foreign exchange crunch \nwere gradually relaxed in 2023. During \nthe time preceding and during the economic \ncrisis in 2021 and 2022, the Government, in \nconsultation with the Central Bank, imposed \na number of exchange restrictions and capital \nflow management measures to overcome the \nsevere shortage of foreign exchange in the \ndomestic foreign exchange market. In addition, \nthe Central Bank itself implemented several \nmeasures to limit foreign exchange outflows \nfrom the country, while encouraging more \ninflows. Most of such exchange restrictions and \nother limitations were eliminated in 2023 in line \nwith the gradual improvement in the liquidity \nconditions in the domestic foreign exchange \nmarket and in view of improving the external \nsector outlook on multiple fronts. In May \n2023, the unremunerated cash margin deposit \nrequirement imposed a year earlier on imports \nof certain items on payment terms of Letters \nof Credit (LC), Documents against  Payment \n(DP), and Documents against Acceptance (DA) \nwere removed. Other such restrictions that \nwere withdrawn include the rationing of foreign \nexchange by the Central Bank and the Central \nBank\u2019s informal guidance to authorised dealers \nto prioritise access to foreign exchange for \nthe imports of essential items. The Minister of \nFinance and the Central Bank issued necessary \nregulations and directions under the provisions \nof the Foreign Exchange Act (FEA) No. 12 \nof 2017 for the purpose of removing certain \nrestrictions on the conversion of Sri Lanka \nrupees into foreign exchange for certain current \ninternational transactions and for removing \ncertain limits on the repatriation of proceeds \nderived from current transactions by emigrants. \nThe previous regulations that were in place \nunder the repealed Exchange Control Act No. \n24 of 1953 on mandatory requirement to \nrepatriate goods export proceeds were reissued, \nunder FEA in October 2019. In February 2021, \nthe mandatory conversion requirement on such \nrepatriated export proceeds was introduced. In \naddition to goods exports, proceeds of services \nexports were also included in the requirement \nof repatriation and mandatory conversion of \nexport proceeds in October 2021.

The \nCentral Bank recommended to the Ministry of \nFinance in May 2023 to relax the restrictions \non imports of temporarily suspended items, \nexcept personal motor vehicles after careful \nconsideration of the improvements observed in \nthe domestic foreign exchange market and the \ngradual buildup of GOR, while also considering \nthe dampening impact of continued import \nrestrictions on economic activity. Accordingly, \nrestrictions on imports of temporarily suspended \nitems were removed in three stages in June, July, \nand October 2023, keeping only motor vehicles \nunder temporary suspension. The restrictions \nperiod, several CFMs were rolled out by the \nGovernment and the Central Bank to discourage \nthe outflows of foreign exchange in order to \nsupport BOP conditions in the country. Once \nBOP conditions started to improve, some of \nthe previously imposed CFMs were gradually \nrelaxed. Accordingly, the temporary suspension \nof payments made through Outward Investment \nAccounts (OIAs) for the purpose of making \noverseas investments by persons resident in \nSri Lanka was relaxed up to a certain level. \nHowever, limitations on making payments \nthrough OIAs for selected capital transactions \ncontinue to remain. In addition, limitations on \noutward remittances for capital transactions \nmade via Business Foreign Currency Accounts \n(BFCAs) held by persons resident in Sri Lanka \nwere also further relaxed. However, temporary \nrestrictions imposed on outward remittances for \ncapital transactions made via Personal Foreign \nCurrency Accounts (PFCAs) held by persons \nresident in Sri Lanka continue. In addition, \nlimitations on the transfer of funds outside \nSri Lanka by emigrants under the migration \nallowance were further relaxed.

These conditions enabled the  \nCentral Bank to buildup international reserves \nsubstantially during the year by purchasing forex \nfrom the domestic market.\n2.4 Financial Sector Policy \nMeasures \n2.4.1 Designation of the \nMacroprudential Authority\nCBA designates the Central Bank as the \nMacroprudential Authority in Sri Lanka. \nThe Act empowers the Central Bank with a \nmandate to exercise, perform and discharge \npowers, duties, and functions in pursuing the \nmacroprudential objectives to achieve financial \nstability. Three intermediate macroprudential \nobjectives are articulated in the Act as \nmaintaining the resilience of the financial system \nin a manner that supports the provision of \nfinancial services even under adverse economic \nand financial conditions; containing risks from \nunsustainable increases in credit and leverage; \ncontaining risks from interconnectedness within \nthe financial system and control the risk of failure \nof individual systemically important institutions. \nThe Central Bank, as the macroprudential \nauthority, is vested with powers, amongst \nother things, to monitor, identify or assess \nthe buildup of risks and vulnerabilities in the \nfinancial system; request, collect, compile, \nanalyse or publish data, information and \nstatistics in order to achieve the macroprudential \nobjectives; conduct stress testing and simulation \nexercises; designate systemically important \nfinancial sector participants; adopt and apply \nthe macroprudential instruments to financial \ninstitutions regulated and supervised by the \nCentral Bank; formulate strategies and policies \nto mitigate or address identified systemic risks; \nidentify gaps in regulation that could pose \nsystemic risks. Furthermore, the Act outlines \nprovisions for the establishment of the Financial \nSystem Oversight Committee (FSOC) to \ncontribute to securing the stability of the financial \nsystem in line with the macroprudential policy by \nbringing aspects of the sector that are not under \nthe direct supervision or regulation of the Central \nBank and ensuring a coordinated approach in \npolicy recommendations. In addition to the suite \nof quantitative and qualitative macroprudential \ninstruments identified by CBA, novel instruments \nand measures may be adopted as necessary to \nsafeguard the resilience of the financial system. \nDuring 2023, the Central Bank continued \nto develop its macroprudential instruments \nto be implemented as part of broad policy \nactions to mitigate or eliminate systemic \nrisks. Accordingly, the Central Bank has \ndeveloped methodologies and frameworks to \nintroduce a Debt-Service-to-Income (DSTI) ratio \nfor the household sector; caps on Loan to Value \n(LTV) for credit facilities for housing purposes \nand the Counter Cyclical Capital Buffer (CCyB). \nThe DSTI and LTV, which are borrower based \nmacroprudential instruments, are envisaged to \ncurb excessive credit demand and to mitigate \nthe buildup of systemic risks while curtailing", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3919, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "95f67196-d385-49da-aca6-6cd624559197": {"__data__": {"id_": "95f67196-d385-49da-aca6-6cd624559197", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "107", "file_name": "economy_review.pdf", "file_path": "/home/lahiru-menik/Documents/Tutorial/RAG-Tutorial/data/economy_review.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9788570, "creation_date": "2025-02-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "86fdda47-89b1-4c11-a22b-b1992ff147c4", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "107", "file_name": "economy_review.pdf", "file_path": "/home/lahiru-menik/Documents/Tutorial/RAG-Tutorial/data/economy_review.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9788570, "creation_date": "2025-02-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-15"}, "hash": "f956c08546fef6c25856a95d6086e6420c8c80e4613da41a6fa6392a7cd612f6", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "86\nCENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA  | ANNUAL ECONOMIC REVIEW 2023\n2 2\npotential credit losses of banks and minimising \nthe risks associated with excessive indebtedness. \nThe CCyB aims to address the procyclicality \nin the financial system, thereby shielding the \nbanking sector from excessive credit growth \nduring the upswings in the cycle and facilitating \nthe supply of credit to the economy during \na downturn.

As per these directions, Licensed \nBanks were required to defer payments of cash \ndividends and profit repatriation for 2023 \nuntil the completion of the external audit of \nfinancial statements/interim financial statements \nfor 2023. Further, Licensed Banks were also \nrequired to refrain from engaging in share \nbuybacks, increasing management allowances, \nand payments to Boards of Directors (BOD), \nand incurring non-essential and/or non-urgent \nexpenditure, while exercising extreme due \ndiligence and prudence when incurring capital \nexpenditure until end 2023. Licensed Banks \nwere further required to form a Board-Level \nSub Committee, to operate during the year \nand in 2024, to evaluate and approve non-\nessential, non-urgent and/or capital expenditure \nto be incurred by the bank. Amendments were \nsubsequently made requiring Licensed Banks to \nrefrain from increasing management allowances \nof Chief Executive Officers (CEO), Key \nManagement Personnel (KMP), and payments \nto BODs, unless the increase is recommended \nby the Human Resource and Remuneration \nCommittee and approved by BOD, subject to \nthe considerations stipulated therein. \nSeveral microprudential measures were also \ntargeted at addressing issues pertaining \nto the liquidity conditions of banks. To \nproactively address probable liquidity constraints \nand their impact on the stability of individual \nbanks and the overall financial sector, a Banking \nAct Determination was issued determining \nqualifying non-financial corporate debt securities \nand qualifying non-financial common equity \nshares, as defined in the Banking Act Directions \non the Liquidity Coverage Ratio under Basel III \nliquidity standards, to be treated as liquid assets \nin the computation of the Statutory Liquid Asset \nRatio of Licensed Banks. \nAmendments were made to the Banking \nAct Direction on \u2018Regulatory Framework \non Technology Risk Management and \nResilience for Licensed Banks\u2019 during \nthe year with the aim of enhancing \nthe information security and resilience \nrequirements for critical information \nsystems while establishing a higher risk \nmanagement measure for the banking \nsector.

Operating Instructions were \namended to expand the scope of the definition \nof community based financial intermediaries \naiming to extend the reach of loan schemes \nthat were previously provided on behalf of \nthe Government. Further, on behalf of the \nGovernment, a loan scheme was introduced \nfor Sri Lankan migrant workers in 2023, in \ncollaboration with the Sri Lanka Bureau of \nForeign Employment, to encourage migrant \nworkers to remit foreign exchange earnings to \nthe country through formal channels. \n2.4.6 Policies on Payments and \nSettlements \nThe Central Bank implemented various \npolicy measures to promote digital \npayments, while ensuring the safety and \nstability of payment systems during the \nyear. The Central Bank continued its efforts to \npromote and enhance digital payments, focusing \non transactions made through the Instant \nPayment System, the Common Electronic Fund \nTransfer Switch (CEFTS). Accordingly, the Multi-\ntiered Liability Manager Limit structure applicable \nto CEFTS was revised to accommodate a larger \nvolume of transactions. \nThe Central Bank directed Licensed Banks to \nintegrate with the LankaPay Online Payment \nPlatform (LPOPP) in 2024 to facilitate \nonline payments to government institutions, \nenhancing efficiency and accessibility for the \npublic.

Introduction\nFinancial literacy that encompasses the knowledge \nand skills required to make informed financial \ndecisions, is integral to individual and societal \neconomic well-being across the globe. The \nsignificance of financial literacy extends across \nvarious dimensions. It influences the economic \noutcomes of individuals by empowering them to \nnavigate the complex world of financial services, \nmake prudent investment choices, manage debts \neffectively, and plan for future financial stability \n(Lone & Bhat 2022). Beyond personal financial \nwell-being, it plays a critical role in shaping the \nmacroeconomic landscape by fostering informed \nconsumer behaviour, enhancing the efficiency \nof financial markets, reducing systemic risks, \npromoting financial inclusion, and supporting \nsustainable economic growth (Lusardi & Mitchell \n2013).\n2. Global Advocacy and Experience in \nImproving Financial Literacy and its relevancy \nfor Sri Lanka\nThe global advocacy for enhancing national \nfinancial literacy levels is a multifaceted \nendeavour, which signifies a collaboration of \ninnovative strategies, professional alliances, \nand a commitment to sustainable development. \nInternational entities such as the Organisation for \nEconomic Cooperation and Development (OECD), \nUnited Nations Development Programme (UNDP) \nWorld Bank, International Finance Corporation \n(IFC) and Alliance for Financial Inclusion (AFI) \nplay pivotal roles in setting international standards \nand providing guidelines, resources, and support \nto countries aiming to enhance their financial \neducation frameworks. \nOverall, these entities emphasise the importance \nof tailored, targeted and inclusive financial literacy \nprogrammes that cater to the diverse needs of \nthe general public, especially vulnerable groups \n(AFI 2021; OECD 2005). As a holistic tool, \nNational Financial Literacy Strategies or Financial \nLiteracy Roadmaps have been utilised globally by  \ngovernments and policymakers to drive a positive \nchange towards enhanced financial inclusion \nlandscapes through improved financial literacy \nlevels (World Bank 2014).\nIn the context of Sri Lanka, the advantages which \ncould be obtained by the implementation of this \nkind of a national initiative are substantial and \nmultifaceted. With the introduction of the Central \nBank of Sri Lanka Act No.16 of 2023 (CBA), the \nCentral Bank is vested with the statutory obligation \nto promote financial inclusion. Thus, on a broader \nfooting, a national scale financial literacy initiative \ncould be considered as the most appropriate tool \nto reach higher financial inclusion levels. \n3.  Current Financial Literacy Landscape of Sri \nLanka \nIn order to identify the financial literacy landscape \nof Sri Lanka, in 2021, the Central Bank jointly \nwith the IFC of the World Bank Group (WBG) \nconducted the first ever nationally representative \nFinancial Literacy Survey in Sri Lanka under the \nAction Plan of the National Financial Inclusion \nStrategy (NFIS). \nResults of the Financial Literacy Survey revealed \nthat when compared to the other countries \nwith comparable survey results, Financial \nKnowledge of Sri Lankans are at satisfactory \nlevels. However, Financial Behaviour is lagging \nbehind, demanding careful consideration of the \npolicymakers. Translating financial knowledge \ninto actual financial behaviour, is a multifaceted \nissue stemming from a range of reasons such as \nissues in financial attitudes, behavioural biases, \nlack of practical experience, socioeconomic \nbarriers, and emotional factors. These elements \ncollectively contribute and widen this gap, \nmaking it challenging for individuals to apply \ntheir understanding of financial principles in \nreal-world scenarios effectively.

Accordingly, \ngender sensitive approaches should be introduced \nto bridge the gender divide.

The Policy Framework: Financial Literacy \nRoadmap of Sri Lanka\nBased on the findings of the Financial Literacy \nSurvey 2021, the Central Bank in collaboration \nwith over 40 stakeholders, including financial sector \nregulators, ministries, academia and other public \nand private sector institutions, led the development \nof the first ever Financial Literacy Roadmap of Sri \nLanka (the Roadmap).\n5. Operationalisation of the Financial Literacy \nRoadmap: Action Plan and Operational Pillars\nThe Roadmap consists of a 05-year Action Plan \nto be implemented from 2024 to 2028 with the \nfundamental objective of improving the financial \nbehaviour of Sri Lankans. The Action Plan currently \nconsists of 48 actions developed to reach 10 \nobjectives across the 04 Strategic Priorities of the \nRoadmap.\nThese actions will be mainly focused on, inter alia,  \nstrengthening the coordination, standardising the \nfinancial literacy materials used by the stakeholders, \nsupporting the transformation of the school children \nto financially capable individuals by the time they \nleave school in collaboration with national level \npublic and private education partners, and utilising \nexisting resources for the effective delivery of the \nfinancial literacy interventions. The NFIS Secretariat \nestablished in the Regional Development \nDepartment of the Central Bank supports to \noperationalize the Action Plan. The existing \ngovernance structure of the NFIS is to oversee and \nensure effective implementation of the Roadmap.  \nAddressing the changing and dynamic financial \nliteracy needs of the economy is of paramount \nimportance for the successful implementation of \nsuch national level financial literacy initiatives. \nThus, the Action Plan of the Roadmap would be a \nliving and open document that could be updated to \naddress such requirements, as necessary.\n6.  The Way Forward\nDespite the remarkable policy commitment and \nthe successful development of the Roadmap, \nthe path ahead is fraught with challenges albeit \npromising opportunities awaiting to be optimised. \nThe success of the Roadmap depends on several \ncritical factors; aligning with national policies, \nadapting to the evolving financial landscapes \nand global trends, creating accessible and", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3187, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1be29550-23c3-4214-bb5e-1d22553cdef8": {"__data__": {"id_": "1be29550-23c3-4214-bb5e-1d22553cdef8", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "112", "file_name": "economy_review.pdf", "file_path": "/home/lahiru-menik/Documents/Tutorial/RAG-Tutorial/data/economy_review.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9788570, "creation_date": "2025-02-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "ccb8b507-2d1d-4e35-ab4b-acd1c5dea197", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "112", "file_name": "economy_review.pdf", "file_path": "/home/lahiru-menik/Documents/Tutorial/RAG-Tutorial/data/economy_review.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9788570, "creation_date": "2025-02-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-15"}, "hash": "901b941358d0c22d0e6c076f659178208df67db62ac473704df79e03fd614e56", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "06a26559-a6d3-435c-98e0-d87da84abd3d", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "756494b6ba051d07de15f1f2825eb196c0a5bb313b3c11180eb4a732e4ac6de3", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "91\nREVIEW OF CENTRAL BANK POLICIES\n2 2\ninclusive financial literacy interventions, fostering \npartnerships, and establishing effective monitoring \nand evaluation frameworks, etc. These steps are \ncrucial to maximise the impact and sustainability of \nfinancial literacy interventions, ultimately leading to \na financially literate and empowered population. \nMoreover, leveraging existing resources such as \ncurrent levels of financial knowledge and skills, \nwidespread access to financial services, and \nincreased digital penetration can catalyse the \nimpact of the interventions. \nUtilising the already established delivery channels \nand networks like the Community Health Network, \nNetwork of Women Development Officers, and \nAgrarian and Samurdhi Societies to deliver the \nfinancial literacy programmes under the Roadmap, \nwill optimise the resource utilisation.

Introduction\nMoney Laundering (ML) and Terrorist Financing \n(TF) pose significant challenges to the world's \nfinancial systems, as well as to national security \nand economic stability. ML and TF affect countries \naround the world by weakening their economies \nand societies. While some countries are at higher \nrisk due to weak governance and corruption, no \ncountry is entirely free from the risks associated \nwith ML and TF. Given the increasing prevalence \nof financial crimes worldwide, fighting against \nML and TF has become a global priority. It \nrequires cooperation among governments and \nlaw enforcement agencies, financial institutions, \ndesignated non-finance businesses and professions, \nand international organisations to protect the \nfinancial system and combat the risks of these \ncrimes.\nThe Financial Action Task Force (FATF), the \nglobal policy setter in Anti-Money Laundering \nand Countering the Financing of Terrorism (AML/\nCFT), plays a vital role in combatting ML and TF \nby establishing global standards and promoting \ncollaboration among nations.  \nAs a proactive step, FATF and FATF-Style Regional \nBodies (FSRBs) conduct Mutual Evaluations (MEs) \nto assess countries' technical compliance with the \nFATF standards and their effective implementation \nof AML/CFT measures. This evaluation process \nhas significant national importance for member \ncountries as it identifies weaknesses in national \nsystems and identifies areas for improvement within \ntheir AML/CFT frameworks. At the same time, it \npromotes a level playing field among countries and \nencourages them to implement AML/CFT measures \non a consistent basis, globally. \nSri Lanka will face its third ME in 2025. Given the \ncountry's past experience of  two MEs which resulted \nin it being included in the FATF \u201cGrey List\u201d and \nsubsequent economic and financial repercussions, \nthe upcoming ME will be a significant event in the \ncountry\u2019s economic and financial progression.\n2. Mutual Evaluation Process\nThe ME process involves an in-depth analysis of a \ncountry\u2019s AML/CFT system undertaken as a peer \nreview. MEs are conducted over a period of 14 \u2013\n18 months and consist of two main components: \ntechnical compliance assessment and effectiveness \nassessment.\n\u2022  Technical compliance: Implementation of the  \n    specific requirements of FATF Recommendations,  \n    including the framework of laws and enforceable \n    means; and the existence, powers and \n    procedures of competent authorities.\n\u2022 Effectiveness assessment:  Effectiveness is the \nextent to which financial systems and economies \nmitigate the risks and threats of money \nlaundering, and financing of terrorism and \nproliferation. This could be in relation to \nthe intended result of a given (a) policy, law, \nor enforceable means; (b) programme of law \nenforcement, supervision, or intelligence activity; \nor (c) implementation of a specific set of \nmeasures.\nThe stages in the ME process throughout which \nthe technical compliance and the effectiveness are \nassessed, are outlined below.\ni.

National Significance of Mutual Evaluations\nThe ME process requires countries to implement \nthe AML/CFT framework efficiently and effectively \nensuring a safe and robust financial system. \nAccordingly, achieving a favourable outcome in \nthe ME process ensures a secure financial system \nby protecting the country's position in the global \nfinancial system and thereby accelerating economic \ngrowth.\nThe following are some of the factors which show \nthe national significance of MEs:\ni.  Preserving Financial Stability: Effective AML/\nCFT measures play a vital role in preserving \nthe integrity and stability of the financial system. \nBy adhering to FATF recommendations, \ncountries mitigate the risk of being a high-risk \njurisdiction, which could adversely affect their \naccess to international banking services and \ncapital markets.\nii. Enhancing National Security: A robust \nAML/CFT regime is essential for national \nsecurity, preventing the use of illicit funds for \nfinancing terrorism and other criminal activities. \nBy undergoing MEs and rectifying identified \nweaknesses, countries strengthen their capacity \nto disrupt illicit financial flows, thereby \nsafeguarding national security interests.\niii.Compliance with International Standards: \nParticipation in MEs is vital for countries to \nshowcase their commitment to adhering to \ninternational AML/CFT standards. Maintaining \nthese standards enhances a country's reputation \nin the global financial community while \npromoting trust among international partners \nand investors.\niv.Facilitating International Cooperation: \nSuccessful MEs promote greater international \ncooperation and information sharing among \ncountries in combating financial crime. \nEnhanced compliance with the FATF standards \nimproves a country's standing within the global \nfinancial system, facilitating efficient \ncollaboration with other jurisdictions in \ninvestigations and enforcement actions. This \ncollaboration strengthens the collective efforts \nto combat ML and TF on a global scale, leading \nto more effective outcomes in preventing and \ndeterring financial crimes. \nv. Identification of Weaknesses: MEs enable \ncountries to identify weaknesses and gaps \nin their AML/CFT frameworks. Countries are \ninformed of vulnerabilities such as legislative \ngaps or deficiencies in enforcement which is \ncrucial for preventing exploitation by criminals \nand enhancing the effectiveness of AML/CFT \nmeasures.\n4. Sri Lanka\u2019s Past Experience of Facing Mutual \nEvaluations \nSri Lanka has undergone two MEs by the Asia/\nPacific Group on Money Laundering (APG), the \nregional FSRB for the Indo-Pacific. The two MEs \nwere in 2006 and 2014/15. Both these evaluations \nresulted in Sri Lanka being listed by the FATF as \na \u201cjurisdiction with strategic deficiencies\u201d in its \nAML/CFT framework, commonly referred to as \n\"Grey Listing\".  The grey-listing resulted in adverse \neconomic and financial consequences on both \noccasions.\nSubsequent to Sri Lanka\u2019s \u201cGrey Listing\u201d by the \nFATF after 2015, the European Commission also \nlisted Sri Lanka as a high risk third country with \nAML/CFT strategic deficiencies in February 2018, \nwhich affected Sri Lanka\u2019s correspondent banking \nrelationships.\nAs Sri Lanka took steps to significantly improve \nits AML/CFT system subsequent to 2015, Sri \nLanka was delisted by the FATF and the European \nCommission in October 2019 and May 2020, \nrespectively.   \n5. Sri Lanka\u2019s Preparedness for the Upcoming \nMutual Evaluation  \nGiven the adverse impacts of past evaluations, \nthe upcoming ME will require Sri Lanka to further  \nstrengthen the country's AML/CFT regime. This \nrequires collective action from stakeholders \nincluding the government and law enforcement \nagencies, financial institutions, designated non-\nfinance businesses and professions, coordinated by \nthe Financial Intelligence Unit of Sri Lanka (FIU-SL).\nIn this context, the country's preparedness is vital \nto showcase its dedication to combating financial \ncrimes. This evaluation provides a thorough \nassessment of Sri Lanka's AML/CFT frameworks, \nhighlighting strengths, weaknesses, and areas \nfor future improvement. Accordingly, several \nkey initiatives have been taken by the FIU-SL, in \npreparation for the ME.  \ni. Establishing an AML/CFT Task Force: A task \nforce for AML/CFT was appointed by the \nCabinet of Ministers, comprising five members \nunder the chairmanship of a retired Supreme \nCourt Justice, to oversee the progress of \nimplementation of the stakeholder-wise \naction plans to address the identified gaps and \ncoordination among relevant stakeholders.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4664, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "88944da8-a826-4a5d-9c62-fa28b80ea682": {"__data__": {"id_": "88944da8-a826-4a5d-9c62-fa28b80ea682", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "116", "file_name": "economy_review.pdf", "file_path": "/home/lahiru-menik/Documents/Tutorial/RAG-Tutorial/data/economy_review.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9788570, "creation_date": "2025-02-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "3f7b738a-43b6-439b-ac4d-7e3be3ac673c", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "116", "file_name": "economy_review.pdf", "file_path": "/home/lahiru-menik/Documents/Tutorial/RAG-Tutorial/data/economy_review.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9788570, "creation_date": "2025-02-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-15"}, "hash": "dd8e0bb0a7eb58e7f4849f5de0d9e3f6ed504c127cb922a6692dd83f537d84d8", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}, "3": {"node_id": "f4b41f8f-9f53-415a-ac03-9301f040f5ab", "node_type": "1", "metadata": {}, "hash": "66847c51d5c7f5e4088af472ddaa7b68297bdf57883f8f9a05f5ce1b563e0503", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "95\nREVIEW OF CENTRAL BANK POLICIES\n2 2\nii. Collaboration with the National \nCoordinating Committee: The AML/CFT \nNational Coordinating Committee (NCC) is \nthe advisory body that maintains national level \ncoordination among stakeholders in \nimplementing AML/CFT measures in Sri Lanka. \nWith the leadership of the NCC and AML/CFT \ntask force, all work relating to the upcoming ME \nis being coordinated.\niii. Conducting National Risk Assessment \n(NRA) in 2021/22: In line with the FATF \nrecommendations, the FIU coordinated the \ncompletion of the second NRA in 2021/22 to \nidentify, assess and understand the ML/TF risks \nfaced by the country. Accordingly, the country\u2019s \noverall ML/TF risk was assessed as \"medium\" \nwhich is a combination of medium level of threat \nand medium level of vulnerability. \niv.Development of AML/CFT National Policy \n2023 \u2013 2028: Based on the findings of the \nNRA, the National AML/CFT Policy for 2023 \n\u2013 2028 was prepared, which was approved by\nthe Cabinet of Ministers, to address the gaps \nidentified to effectively combat ML and TF in the \ncountry.\nv. Developing stakeholder-wise action plans: \nWith the purpose of preparing the key \nstakeholders for the next ME, the stakeholder-\nwise action plans for relevant 24 stakeholder \ninstitutions were approved by the Cabinet of \nMinisters to improve the effectiveness and \ntechnical compliance level of AML/CFT \nframework of the country. The action plans \nwere distributed among stakeholders with regular \nupdates being provided by them to the NCC and \nto the AML/CFT task force.\nvi. Carrying out legislative amendments: In \norder to further strengthen the legal framework \non AML/CFT and to ensure adherence to the \ninternational standards, the FIU is in the process \nof amending key legislations which includes \nthe Financial Transactions Reporting Act, No. \n06 of 2006; the Prevention of Money \nLaundering Act, No. 05 of 2006; the \nConvention on the Suppression of Terrorist \nFinancing Act, No. 25 of 2005. The FIU is \nalso assisting in making the amendments to \nthe Companies Act, No. 07 of 2007. These \namendments are expected to be completed by \nthe third quarter of 2024.\n6. Conclusion\nFATF MEs are events of national significance for \nmember countries, as they play a vital role in \nassessing compliance with international AML/\nCFT standards, identifying weaknesses in national \nframeworks, enhancing national security, facilitating \ninternational cooperation, and preserving financial \nstability. By actively participating in the ME process, \ncountries can strengthen the measures against \nfinancial crime and contribute to a safer and more \nsecure global financial environment. Accordingly, \ncollective efforts of all key stakeholders will \nensure that Sri Lanka\u2019s AML/CFT framework is \nimplemented efficiently and effectively, enabling the \ncountry to achieve a better compliance level at the \nupcoming ME while strengthening its position within \nthe global financial community. 1\nReferences\n1.

These steps are aimed at \nfacilitating the preparation of resolution plans for \nlicensed financial institutions, ultimately ensuring \nalignment with global standards and bolstering \nthe stability of the financial system in Sri Lanka. \nCBA and the Banking (Special Provisions) \nAct recognise the establishment of the \nSri Lanka Deposit Insurance Scheme \n(SLDIS) as a means of upholding public \nconfidence and promoting and contributing \nto the stability of the financial system in \nSri Lanka. The Banking (Special Provisions) \nAct articulates operational procedures for the \nadministration and management of SLDIS and \nentrusts powers, duties and functions related \nto the Deposit Insurance Fund. The Financial \nSector Safety Net Strengthening Project (FSSNP), \nwhich was initiated with the collaboration of \nthe Government and the World Bank, seeks to \nfortify the financial and institutional capacities \nof SLDIS in accordance with international \nstandards. Under the FSSNP initiative, SLDIS was \nstrengthened through a financing mechanism \noffered by the World Bank and backstop \nfunding arrangements were established with the \nGovernment. A new investment policy is being \ndrafted to expand SLDIS\u2019 investment portfolio \nacross a range of instruments in both local and \ninternational financial markets.

To \naddress customer concerns regarding digital \npayment methods, the Central Bank has taken \nproactive steps. A trilingual web form was \nintroduced on the Central Bank's website to \ncreate public awareness regarding unsafe, \nunsound, or unfair practices relating to payment \nservices. The Central Bank also remains active \non all forms of social media to ensure that \nessential messages, not only on monetary \npolicy, but also those related to the financial \nsystem, including scams and prohibited financial \nschemes, are disseminated promptly. \nDuring the year, steps were taken to \nimprove stakeholder engagement.

Sri Lankan economy is expected to continue to recover and reach its potential in \nthe coming years, bolstered by the return of greater macroeconomic stability. Assuming \nthe uninterrupted continuation of ongoing ambitious reforms and economic adjustments \nunderpinned by the Extended Fund Facility (EFF) programme of the International Monetary \nFund (IMF), stability is envisaged on multiple fronts. Following the swift disinflation process, \ninflation is expected to remain around the target of 5 per cent on average during 2024, despite \nintermittent fluctuations caused by supply side shocks amid lower demand conditions. Inflation \nis expected to stabilise around the target over the medium term, supported by appropriate \npolicy measures. The Central Bank\u2019s independence coupled with greater public accountability \nin monetary policymaking would be instrumental in maintaining domestic price stability over \nthe medium term. Early signs of economic recovery that were observed in the second half of \n2023 are expected to translate into a broadbased recovery across all sectors in the ensuing \nperiod. Despite a possible widening in the trade deficit driven by the revival of imports along \nwith increased economic activity, the external sector is anticipated to build upon the favourable \ndevelopments in 2023, with the revived tourism sector, elevated levels of workers\u2019 remittances, \nand expected non-debt creating inflows, while augmenting external buffers.

Global growth is projected to remain \naround 3.1 per cent in 2024 and accelerate to \n3.2 per cent in 2025 on account of the stronger \nrebound in several large economies, including \nthe United States (US), and fiscal stimulus in \nChina. However, the projected global growth \nrates for 2024-2025 are below the historical \naverage (2000-2019) of 3.8 per cent, reflecting \nthe impact of restrictive monetary policies to \ncurb inflation, fiscal tightening amidst high \ndebt weighing on economic activity, and low \nunderlying productivity growth. Advanced \neconomies are expected to experience a \nslowdown, with growth dropping from 2.6  \nper cent in 2022 to 1.6 per cent in 2023 and \n1.5 per cent in 2024, before rising to 1.8  \nper cent in 2025. Although Eurozone economies \nand the United Kingdom are expected to recover \nfrom their low rates of growth in 2024, owing \nto waning effects of the war in Ukraine, the \nmoderate growth in advanced economies is \nmainly attributed to the slowdown in the US with \nlagged effects of monetary policy tightening \nas well as contractionary fiscal policies. This \nanticipated growth moderation in advanced \neconomies could have an adverse impact on \nSri Lanka\u2019s export performance as the US and \nthe European Union are the largest export \ndestinations for Sri Lanka. Also, subdued \neconomic growth in advanced economies may \nalso have a bearing on the much anticipated \nresurgence of high-spending tourist arrivals to \nSri Lanka. Meanwhile, emerging markets and \ndeveloping economies are expected to maintain \na stable growth of 4.1 per cent in 2023 and \n2024, the same as in 2022, which is expected \nto rise to 4.2 per cent in 2025. The resilience \nin these economies mainly reflects the strong \ngrowth rates in India and China. The Indian \neconomy is estimated to have grown by 6.7  \nper cent in 2023 and projected to remain \nstrong at 6.5 per cent in both 2024 and 2025 \nreflecting robust domestic demand. Economic \ngrowth in China is estimated at 5.2 per cent in \n2023 and it is projected at 4.6 per cent and \n4.1 per cent in 2024 and 2025, respectively, \nconsidering the increased fiscal support to \nbuild capacity against natural disasters.

Global inflation \nis expected to have gradually decelerated \nfrom 8.7 per cent in 2022 to 6.8 per cent in \n2023 and projected to moderate further to \n5.8 per cent in 2024. Although commodity \nprices, mainly oil prices, are expected to \ndecline over the next two years contributing to \nfaster disinflation, new commodity price spikes \nresulting from geopolitical shocks, including \npossible escalation of the conflict in Gaza to the \nMiddle East region as well as continued attacks \nin the Red Sea, could accelerate global inflation. \nHigher global energy prices may result in \nincreased import expenditure thereby widening \nthe trade deficit while also weighing on inflation \nin many countries, including Sri Lanka.  \nMeanwhile, weather related shocks such as \nfloods and droughts together with the El Ni\u00f1o \nphenomenon could cause food price hikes \nand jeopardise efforts to restore price stability \nglobally. Additionally, many economies \nface significant debt distress risks due to \nescalating debt service costs necessitating fiscal \nconsolidation measures which could hinder \ngrowth prospects further.\nThe global monetary policy stance which \nwas gradually tightened in 2022 in view \nof rising inflationary pressures, was further \ntightened to significantly high levels during \n2023 as inflation remained excessively \nstubborn. Supply disruptions due to geopolitical \ntensions, lagged effects of monetary and fiscal \nstimulus during the pandemic, high inflation \nexpectations, and wage pressures were key \nfactors that contributed to the persistence in \ninflation in many advanced and emerging \nmarket economies. Despite some early signs of \ninflation moderating, incoming data and other \nunfavourable global developments such as the \neconomic decoupling where Western economies \nhave loosened ties with China, and tensions \nin the Red Sea and its impact on global and \nregional supply chains, together with downward \nrigid core inflation levels have led central banks \nglobally to remain cautious in easing their \nmonetary policy stance in 2024. Meanwhile, \nthe US dollar strengthened against other major \ncurrencies so far in 2024. This can be attributed \nto robust economic performance in the US, \nincluding higher than expected surge in new \njob additions to the US economy. Further, the \ndelay in normalisation of interest rates amidst \npersistent inflationary pressures is also expected \nto contribute towards a stronger US dollar in the \nnear future.\n3.2 Domestic Economic Outlook\n3.2.1 Inflation Outlook\nDespite intermittent fluctuations caused by \nsupply side deviations amid lower demand \nconditions, inflation is expected to stabilise \naround the targeted level over the medium \nterm, supported by appropriate policy \nmeasures. Following the rapid disinflation \nprocess, inflation reached lower single digit \nlevels towards end 2023. However, a temporary \nuptick in inflation was observed during early \n2024, mainly driven by the Value Added Tax \n(VAT) adjustments implemented in January \n2024. Nevertheless, the realised data thus \nfar in 2024 indicates that the direct impact of \nthe VAT change on inflation and its second \nround effects may not be as large as initially \nenvisaged amidst subdued demand.

This projected path of core inflation \nis also contributed by the fact that it may not \nbenefit from the direct impact of reduced \nelectricity tariffs as energy related expenses are \nnot included in the core consumption basket, \nand the relatively high persistence that is usually \nobserved in core inflation. Similar to headline \ninflation, core inflation is expected to follow a \ndeclining trend in early 2025, partly contributed \nby the favourable base effect, albeit at a lower \nrevisions to electricity tariffs effective from March \n2024 and the moderation in food prices. These \neffects partially accounted for the considerable \nreduction of inflation observed in March \n2024, and as per the current projections of the \nCentral Bank,1 they are expected to contribute \nto inflation remaining below the target of 5 per \ncent during the second quarter of 2024. The \ntrajectory for headline inflation during the latter \nhalf of the year could be somewhat impacted \nby the next round of revisions to electricity tariffs \nand cost reflective monthly revisions to fuel \nand gas prices. However, inflation is expected \nto remain around the target of 5 per cent, on \naverage, during 2024. As per currently available \n1 The Central Bank uses a Quarterly Projection Model (QPM), which is a semi-structural \nmacroeconomic model, to arrive at medium term macroeconomic projections. \nProjections are updated during each monetary policy round, using data on the latest \neconomic developments, including, but not limited to, monthly releases of inflation \ndata and quarterly releases of GDP data by the Department of Census and Statistics \n(DCS) and global macroeconomic forecasts. In addition to data updates, forecast near \nterm movements of key macroeconomic variables together with staff judgements, are \ntaken as key inputs for QPM based medium term projections. The projections discussed \nin the Annual Economic Review 2023 are based on the March 2024 forecast round.\n*Realised data up to Q4 2022 shown in the fan chart are based on CCPI (2013=100, seasonally adjusted), while data after this period are based on CCPI (2021=100, seasonally adjusted).\nNote: A forecast is neither a promise nor a commitment\nThe projections reflect the available data, assumptions and judgements made at the forecast round in March 2024.\nThe fan chart illustrates the uncertainty surrounding the baseline projection path using confidence bands of gradually fading colours. The confidence intervals (CI) shown on the chart indicate the ranges of values within \nwhich inflation may fluctuate over the medium term. For example, the thick green shaded area represents the 50 per cent confidence interval, implying that there is a 50 per cent probability that the realised inflation outcome \nwill be within this interval.

The confidence intervals (CI) shown on the chart indicate the ranges of values within \nwhich real GDP growth may fluctuate over the medium term. For example, the thick blue shaded area represents the 50 per cent confidence interval, implying that there is a 50 per cent probability that the realised real \nGDP growth will be within this interval. The confidence bands show the increasing uncertainty in forecasting macroeconomic variables over a longer horizon. Given the volatile global environment and the uncertainties in \nthe domestic economy, the baseline forecasts are exposed to various potential upside and downside risks.

This \nsurplus can mainly be attributed to the notable \nreduction in merchandise imports, significant \nincrease in earnings from tourism and healthy \ngrowth in workers\u2019 remittances. Over the years,  \nSri Lanka has been experiencing persistent external \ncurrent account deficits mainly driven by large \ndeficits in the merchandise trade account. Although \nthe trade in services account and secondary income \naccount recorded surpluses, such surpluses were not \nsufficient to cushion the impact of merchandise trade \nand primary income account deficits on the current \naccount (Figure B 7.1).\nHistorically, global experiences show that after a \nsignificant economic shock, such as a BOP crisis \nleading to a debt default, the subsequent adjustment \nin the exchange rate and corrective policy measures \nresult in an immediate current account surplus. \nIn this context, historical experiences show that \nsome countries were able to sustain a surplus in \nthe current account in the medium to long term \nfollowing a period of economic distress. At the same \ntime, there were countries that reverted to their \nhistorical trend of recording deficits (Figure B 7.2). \nGenerally, countries that have been able to sustain \nsuch surpluses in the long run were able to stabilise \nthe exchange rate at an elevated level compared \nto that of pre-crisis level, supporting export \ncompetitiveness, while managing inflation at lower \nlevels. Sustaining these surpluses was supported by \npolicies aimed at gradually accelerating real GDP \ngrowth and improving fiscal performance (i.e., \nimproved primary balance and lower budget deficit). \nIn this context, it is important to explore the factors \ninfluencing the sustainability of current account \nsurpluses post-economic shocks and economic \nimplications of maintaining persistent current \naccount surpluses or deficits.\nThe current account balance mirrors the  \nsavings-investment gap in the country. A current \naccount surplus reflects a positive savings-investment \ngap whereas a deficit reflects a negative  \nsavings-investment gap. In Sri Lanka, along with \nthe current account surplus, the national savings-\ninvestment gap took an upturn to record a positive \nvalue in 2023. This surplus can be attributed to the \ncombined effect of reduced domestic investment and \na notable increase in net current transfers from the \nrest of the world, leading to an increase in national \nsavings.\nCountry Experiences\nDuring the East Asian Financial Crisis of  \n1997-1998, countries such as Thailand, South \nKorea, Indonesia, Philippines and Malaysia \nexperienced BOP distress that led to a multitude \nof macroeconomic shocks, including sharp \ndepreciation of local currencies.

Even with the continued growth in import \nexpenditure, the trade deficit is expected to \nreach manageable levels in the medium term, \ncrisis in 2020 resulting in a sharp exchange rate \ndepreciation and BOP challenges. Although Zambia \nwas able to experience temporary current account \nsurpluses in the aftermath of the crisis, the current \naccount is estimated to have reverted to a deficit \nin 2023 due to a significant contraction in copper \nexports and imports returning to high levels (IMF \n2023). Similar experiences can be observed in the \ncases of Argentina, Mexico and Ecuador where \nthe current account deficits turned into surpluses \nin the aftermath of the debt crises followed by debt \nrestructuring. However, these surpluses did not \npersist. Therefore, it is evident that countries have \nhad mixed experiences with respect to sustaining \npost-crises current account surpluses, depending on \na multitude of factors, including structural reforms, \ndiversification strategies, prudent macroeconomic \nmanagement as well as the country\u2019s ability to \nwithstand external vulnerabilities.\nAre current account surpluses always good?\nA current account surplus may be considered \nfavourable for the purpose of building up reserves. \nHowever, a persistent surplus may lead to significant \nappreciation of the local currency which would \nnecessitate the Central Bank to intervene in the \ndomestic foreign exchange market to avoid undue \nappreciation of the currency to ensure maintenance \nof trade competitiveness. However, adopting such \npractices for extended time periods may lead to \nsuch countries being labelled as stereotypical \n\u201ccurrency manipulators\u201d who maintain their \ncurrencies undervalued, akin to an export subsidy, \nto boost their trade surpluses. Moreover, if the \ncurrent account surplus is achieved as a result of \nlow domestic demand or compressed imports due \nto restrictive trade policies, it can hinder domestic \nconsumption and investment affecting future \neconomic growth. In order to achieve a sustainable \ncurrent account balance in the aftermath of an \neconomic crisis, adopting an appropriate policy \nmix is required while ensuring that there will be no \ndisruptive adjustments. In this regard, adopting a \nflexible exchange rate policy, where the exchange \nrate is determined based on demand and supply \nconditions in the domestic foreign exchange \nmarket, maintaining low and stable inflation, and \nfocusing on export promotion and diversification are \nessential. \nConclusion\nThere is no agreement among academia or  \npolicymakers on an optimal level of current \naccount balance or whether a country should \nmaintain a persistent current account deficit or a \nsurplus (Ghosh and Ramakrishnan 2006; Devadas \nand Loayza 2018; World Economic Forum 2023). \nNeither a current account deficit nor a surplus \nalone could be interpreted as favourable or \nunfavourable for an economy. A current account is \nconsidered to be sustainable if external deficits do \nnot necessitate an immediate change in monetary \nor fiscal policy or do not result in a BOP crisis \nleading to a strain on the country\u2019s international \nreserve level or having adverse implications \non its ability to service external debt. Although \nrecording a current account surplus is interpreted \nas favourable for an economy which had recorded \npersistent deficits historically, a persistent current \naccount surplus may reflect an undervalued \ncurrency so that it may subsequently necessitate \nan appreciation of the country\u2019s local currency \nleading to a loss of trade competitiveness. In \nconclusion, if Sri Lanka could adopt and maintain \nan appropriate policy mix with export promotion \nand diversification, which would result in a stable \nexchange rate, lower inflation levels and gradual \neconomic growth path, the country would be able \nto maintain a sustainable current account balance \nover the medium to long term.\nReferences\n1.

The envisaged \ncredit growth and the gradual easing of  \ntrade-related restrictions and improving \nrepayment capacities are expected to improve \nthe credit quality of the banking sector. Liquidity \nlevels of the banks are expected to improve \nwith the envisaged EDR as net foreign currency \ncredit to the sovereign and illiquid foreign \ncurrency sovereign instruments are likely to be \nexchanged with liquid sovereign instruments. The \nGovernment endeavours to achieve a smooth \nEDR operation with minimal macro-financial \nimpact through pre-emptive policy interventions \nand behavioural responses. The banking sector \nis formulating comprehensive recapitalisation \nplans for its top tier domestic Licensed \nCommercial Banks (LCBs) with the view of \nstrengthening the resilience to enable a smooth \nsovereign debt restructuring while averting the \ntransmission of negative spillovers across the \neconomy. The credit growth of the Licensed \nFinance Companies (LFCs) sector is expected \nto resemble a trajectory similar to that of the \nbanking sector with continued diversification \namidst limited growth opportunities for \nconventional loan products. The credit risk in \nthe LFCs sector is expected to ease with the \nenvisaged recovery in macro-financial conditions \nand credit rebound.  \nAn array of structural, legal and policy level \nreforms and innovations will continue to \nbe mobilised to ensure the stability of the \nfinancial system. Consolidation endeavours \nare expected to continue in 2024, enhancing \nthe resilience and efficiency of the LFCs sector. \nA robust growth in digital transactions is \nexpected in the landscape of payments and \nsettlements due to increased transactions \nthrough Instant Payment System facilitated by \nonline banking and mobile payment apps. \nAwareness campaigns on digital transaction \nmethods will be conducted to increase the \nuptake of digital payments by customers and \nmerchants. The Central Bank will closely \ncollaborate with financial institutions to support \nthe expansion of safe, efficient and reliable \ndigital payment mechanisms in the country. The \nCentral Bank as the Macroprudential Authority \nof the country envisages to implement its suite \nof macroprudential tools when the need arises \nto contain systemic imbalances with the view \nof maintaining financial sector resilience and \nto support the smooth provision of financial \nservices even under adverse economic and \nfinancial conditions.", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 4025, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "a3405ff7-e27f-48f2-8f9e-4bbb1797e128": {"__data__": {"id_": "a3405ff7-e27f-48f2-8f9e-4bbb1797e128", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "137", "file_name": "economy_review.pdf", "file_path": "/home/lahiru-menik/Documents/Tutorial/RAG-Tutorial/data/economy_review.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9788570, "creation_date": "2025-02-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "9edfdc9c-2e18-4c7f-8f14-df2133c2e67e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "137", "file_name": "economy_review.pdf", "file_path": "/home/lahiru-menik/Documents/Tutorial/RAG-Tutorial/data/economy_review.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9788570, "creation_date": "2025-02-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-15"}, "hash": "9d0cca621bd7acc632a8a0ca14fbad5247f69eb5d06d0c372abd24f4bb0b2cac", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "116\nCENTRAL BANK OF SRI LANKA  | ANNUAL ECONOMIC REVIEW 2023\n3 3\nThe instigation and timely implementation \nof well sequenced-consistent policies are \nexpected to ensure the stability of the \nfinancial system. The continued advancement \nalong the policy reform agenda envisaged in \nthe IMF-EFF programme is expected to address \nthe shortfalls and weaknesses of the financial \nsector and to further strengthen the resilience \nand confidence in the system. Despite all such \nefforts, if political uncertainties exert significant \npressure on the reform agenda going forward, \nwhich could lead to departure from the intended \npolicy reform trajectory, it may result in adverse \nand potentially irreversible impacts on both the \nfinancial system and the economy.\n3.2.6 Fiscal Sector Outlook\nThe Government is expected to continue \nthe fiscal consolidation path and its efforts \nto restore debt sustainability in line with the \nIMF-EFF supported programme, showcasing \nthe Government\u2019s commitment to prudent \nfiscal management and implementation of \nlong overdue structural reforms. As per the \nrevised Medium Term Macro Fiscal Framework \n(MTMFF) outlined in the Fiscal Management \nReport 2024, the Government aims to achieve \nan ambitious revenue target, surpassing 15  \nper cent of GDP by 2027. Simultaneously, \nefforts are directed towards containing the \noverall budget deficit to below 5 per cent of \nGDP starting from 2026, while striving to \nachieve a primary surplus of at least 2.3  \nper cent of GDP by 2025 and beyond. Aligned \nwith this stance, the Government implemented \nrobust revenue enhancement measures since \nmid-2022, and the impact of these fiscal policy \nreforms has been reflected in the Government's \nfinances since 2023, resulting in a significant \nincrease in tax revenue collection. Furthermore, \nthe envisaged introduction of a property tax as \nwell as a gift and inheritance tax, is expected \nin 2025, further augmenting tax collection \nif implemented as scheduled. Revenue \nenhancement in the forthcoming periods is \nalso expected through the strengthening of \nrevenue administration measures. Compulsory \nregistration of individuals for personal income \ntaxes, strengthening of large taxpayers and high \nwealth taxpayers units, upgrading the Revenue \nAdministration and Management Information \nSystem (RAMIS), and the abolishment of the \nSimplified Value Added Tax (SVAT) system are \nexpected to improve revenue administration \nefforts of revenue collecting agencies. \nRecent efforts by the Government mandating \ninformation sharing by the financial institutions, \nCSE, Registrar General\u2019s Department, Registrar \nGeneral of Companies and Department \nof Motor Traffic with the Inland Revenue \nDepartment, is a welcoming move to build \ninterlinkages with government institutions and the \nrevenue authority to improve tax administration \nand minimise tax evasion. However, any reversal \nof hard earned fiscal sector achievements prior \nto or after the upcoming elections will derail the \nIMF programme and destabilise the economy, \nthereby triggering a deeper socioeconomic and \npolitical crisis than that was observed in 2022. \nAdditionally, the Government aims to manage \nexpenditure within 20 per cent of GDP over the \nmedium term. While streamlining government \nexpenditure, making appropriate allocations to \npriority areas such as health, education, public \ntransport, and social protection, as outlined \nin MTMFF, is pivotal for equitable and faster \neconomic recovery. The implementation of \nthe new legislations related to Public Financial \nManagement and Public Procurement is \nexpected to strengthen fiscal discipline through \nthe establishment of a framework of fiscal \nrules, enhanced transparency, monitoring \nmechanisms, and stricter discipline on \ngovernment procurement. In addition, the \nGovernment is implementing a stringent project \nappraisal and prioritisation process with regard \nto capital projects to align capital expenditure", "mimetype": "text/plain", "start_char_idx": 0, "end_char_idx": 3974, "metadata_seperator": "\n", "text_template": "{metadata_str}\n\n{content}", "class_name": "TextNode"}, "__type__": "1"}, "1508384f-5713-4c3a-8336-94effca69407": {"__data__": {"id_": "1508384f-5713-4c3a-8336-94effca69407", "embedding": null, "metadata": {"page_label": "138", "file_name": "economy_review.pdf", "file_path": "/home/lahiru-menik/Documents/Tutorial/RAG-Tutorial/data/economy_review.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9788570, "creation_date": "2025-02-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-15"}, "excluded_embed_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "excluded_llm_metadata_keys": ["file_name", "file_type", "file_size", "creation_date", "last_modified_date", "last_accessed_date"], "relationships": {"1": {"node_id": "5317849b-af0f-455e-8720-e569a8f5b17e", "node_type": "4", "metadata": {"page_label": "138", "file_name": "economy_review.pdf", "file_path": "/home/lahiru-menik/Documents/Tutorial/RAG-Tutorial/data/economy_review.pdf", "file_type": "application/pdf", "file_size": 9788570, "creation_date": "2025-02-15", "last_modified_date": "2025-02-15"}, "hash": "0bf3940275c673d0329a2759a9b23e3c292f01e111ac5e995afabd54e5682ea2", "class_name": "RelatedNodeInfo"}}, "metadata_template": "{key}: {value}", "metadata_separator": "\n", "text": "117\nMACROECONOMIC OUTLOOK\n3 3\nwith development priorities in a cost effective \nmanner.

The completion of \nthe restructuring of the foreign debt portfolio \nand adherence to the fiscal consolidation path \nthat the Government has committed under the \nIMF-EFF programme are expected to bring \ndown the debt trajectory to a sustainable \nlevel in the medium term.

Definitional changes have been adopted in aggregating DBUs and OBUs to avoid double counting and misclassification of assets and liabilities.\n(c)   NDA is equal to the sum of net credit to Government (NCG), claims on public corporations/State Owned Business Enterprises (SOBEs), claims on private sector and \nother items (net).\n(d)   Demand deposits held by the public\n(e)  This includes NFA of the Central Bank as well as the Government\u2019s Crown Agent\u2019s balance reported by the Department of State Accounts.\n(f) The Central Bank adopted International Accounting Standards in January 2002. Accordingly, since then foreign assets are recorded at market value, which reflects its\n       impact in NFA and NDA of Monetary Authorities. Therefore, the values for the period prior to January 2002 are not comparable with the values thereafter.\n(g)   Credit extended to the Government by the banking system, net of government deposits with banks and government\u2019s cash balances.\n(h)  Monetary data since 1990 were reclassifed to be consistent with standard international practices. Accordingly, rupee deposits held by non-residents are excluded from \nthe total demand, time and savings deposits held by the public. The excluded amount is classified under foreign liabilities.\n(i)  Velocity of money, which is calculated based on annual average M2b is computed based on year-end M2b only for 1991.\n(j)

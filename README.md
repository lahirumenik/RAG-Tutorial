RAG-Tutorial: Retrieval-Augmented Generation for Beginners

Introduction

This tutorial introduces Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in a simple way. It allows an AI model to find relevant information from a document collection before generating an answer. This can help provide accurate and context-aware responses.

What are Embeddings?

Embeddings are a way to represent words or documents as numbers so that similar meanings have similar numbers.

For example:

"cat" and "kitten" will have similar embeddings because they are related.

"car" and "vehicle" will also have similar embeddings.

But "apple" and "car" will have very different embeddings since they are unrelated.

This is useful in RAG because when you ask a question, the AI finds the most relevant text from a large document using embeddings before generating a response.

Imagine you have a 1000-page PDF and you ask, "What is inflation?" Instead of reading all 1000 pages, the AI quickly finds the section about inflation and gives you an answer from it.

How to Set Up and Run This RAG Tutorial

Follow these steps to install and run the project on your computer.

1. Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/RAG-Tutorial.git

2. Navigate to the Project Folder

cd RAG-Tutorial

3. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

Windows:

python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate

Linux & macOS:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

4. Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

5. Download a Small Language Model Locally

python download.py

Note: This will download about 2GB of data.

6. Run the Application

python app.py

After running this, it will show a Gradio link (e.g., http://127.0.0.1:7860)

Open the link in your browser to interact with the RAG system.

7. Experiment with RAG

The main logic is in rag.py, which contains comments explaining the retrieval and generation process.

Key Features of This Tutorial

âœ… Uses local models, so no API keys are needed.
âœ… Can run on CPU, so no GPU is required.
âœ… Designed for learning purposes with simple implementation.
âœ… Covers basic retrieval and generation steps.

Future Improvements

This is a simple RAG system. For better results, consider:

Better embeddings for improved retrieval.

Using metadata in search.

Finetuning the LLM for improved answers.

Adjusting retrieval parameters to get more relevant documents.

Using cross-encoder reranking for better selection.

This tutorial is designed to help you understand RAG basics and experiment with it on your own machine. Happy learning! ðŸš€

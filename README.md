## Key Features of This Tutorial

âœ… Uses **local models**, so no API keys are needed.  
âœ… Can run on **CPU**, so no GPU is required.  

## Introduction

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a smart way to find the right information before answering a question. Instead of just making up an answer, it first looks through a set of documents, picks out the most useful parts, and then creates a response based on that information. This makes the answer more accurate and reliable.

RAG can be used in many real-life situations. One example is a study assistant for students. Instead of searching through textbooks, notes, or online materials manually, students can ask a question, and the system will find the best answer by looking through study materials. This makes learning faster and easier.

## Prerequisites

No prior knowledge of Natural Language Processing (NLP) is needed to follow this tutorial. A basic understanding of Python is sufficient to get started.

### What are Embeddings?

Embeddings are a way to represent words or documents as numbers so that similar meanings have similar numbers.

For example:

- **"cat"** and **"kitten"** will have similar embeddings because they are related.
- **"car"** and **"vehicle"** will also have similar embeddings.
- But **"apple"** and **"car"** will have very different embeddings since they are unrelated.

This is useful in RAG because when you ask a question, the AI finds the most relevant text from a large document using embeddings before generating a response.

Since texts are represented using vectors which contains number, it is possible to use mathematical operations using vectors (Cosine Similarity) to identifies contets that is similar to each others.

Imagine you have a **1000-page PDF** and you ask an question, Instead of reading all 1000 pages, using embeddings, it is possible finds the sections that are related to your question and gives you an answer from it.


### What is a Vector Store?

A vector store is a specialized database designed to store and retrieve high-dimensional vectors efficiently. These vectors, also known as embeddings, are numerical representations of data (such as text, images, or audio) that capture semantic relationships. Unlike traditional databases that store raw text or structured data, vector stores allow for similarity searches, meaning they can quickly find items that are semantically related rather than just exact matches.For this tutorial we will use FAISS as the vector store. 

### Vector Store in This Tutorial

For this tutorial, a FAISS vector store has already been created using a document issued by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka. [https://www.cbsl.gov.lk/sites/default/files/cbslweb_documents/publications/aer/2023/en/Full_Text.pdf] 
You can also add your own document(s) to the `data` directory and run `vectorstore.py`, which will:

- Divide the document page by page.
- Create an embedding for each page.
- Store these embeddings in the FAISS vector store for efficient retrieval.

Note that there is an embedding model to convert text in to embeddings. you can observe that in `vectorstore.py` file


## How RAG Works

When you ask a question:

1. The system converts your question into a vector embedding (a numerical representation).
2. It searches the vector store to find the most relevant stored embeddings. (Use vector calculations to find similarities)
3. It retrieves the best-matching text and generates an answer using LLM

## How to Set Up and Run This RAG Tutorial

Follow these steps to install and run the project on your computer.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/lahirumenik/RAG-Tutorial.git
```

### 2. Navigate to the Project Folder

```bash
cd RAG-Tutorial
```

### 3. Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

#### Windows:

```bash
python -m venv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
```

#### Linux & macOS:

```bash
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 4. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 5. Download a Small Language Model Locally

```bash
python download.py
```

*Note: This will download about **1GB** of data.*

### 6. Run the Application

```bash
python app.py
```

- After running this, it will show a **Gradio link** (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:7860`)
- Open the link in your browser to interact with the RAG system.

Current vector store is created by a document 'Economic Review of Sri Lanka for 2023'. There you can try questions like 'How VAT related to inflation in 2024?', 'In which period daily power cut has started in Sri Lnaka and waht is the reason for it?' and further you can create a question by studying the cuurent document in data directory. After that try to create your own vector store as described above.

### 7. Experiment with RAG

The main logic for Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is implemented in **rag.py**. This file contains detailed comments explaining the retrieval and generation process.  

To deepen your understanding, study the **rag.py** file and experiment with it by:  
 
- Using your own documents by adding them to the `data` folder.  
- Running `vectorstore.py` to process the documents and update the FAISS vector store.
- Changing different parameters in `rag.py` to observe how they affect retrieval and generation. 

After modifying parameters and adding new documents, execute the RAG pipeline to analyze its performance and see how retrieval affects the final generated response.  
 
This tutorial is designed to help you **understand RAG basics** and experiment with it on your own machine. Happy learning! ðŸš€
